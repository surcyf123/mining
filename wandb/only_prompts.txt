\section{Introduction}
Under certain conditions, a gap can open in the spectrum of 
electromagnetic waves in a dielectric medium, independent of the
direction of their propagation \cite{Y,Jo}. 
Dielectric structures possessing such a photonic band gap are promising 
candidates for various technological applications \cite{Y}.
Moreover, such structures offer a new laboratory to study various 
atomic processes. Indeed, if a gap opens in the spectrum
of electromagnetic waves, all parameters and characteristics of atom
placed in such a medium,
such as, for example,  atomic radius and its spontaneous emission rates
are expected to change.


In order to open such a gap, one considers
Maxwell's equations in a dielectric with a spatially periodic dielectric
function, in full analogy to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation
with a periodic potential \cite{Y,Jo}. In the latter case, the spectrum can be 
classified according to the Bloch momentum ${\bf k}$. Energy (frequency) 
levels $\nu_n$ are continuous functions of the Bloch momentum ${\bf k}$
in the (first) Brillouin zone. 
We say that there is a full gap, or simply a {\em gap}
 between the $n$th and $(n+1)$th 
levels when $\nu_{n+1}({\bf k})>\nu_n({\bf k}')$ for all  ${\bf k}$ 
and ${\bf k}'$. We say that there is a {\em direct gap} between the $n$th 
and $(n+1)$th levels when $\nu_{n+1}({\bf k})>\nu_n({\bf k})$ for all  
${\bf k}$.
For the Schr\"{o}dinger equation in one space dimension, the number 
of gaps is in general infinite and the only periodic potential which
does not open any gap in the spectrum is a constant potential
\cite{E}. However, the situation changes dramatically in two and 
higher dimensions. One can prove rigorously
that the number of gaps  in the spectrum can only  be  finite   
and, if the  potential is not strong enough, no gap opens in the 
spectrum \cite{S}. If electromagnetic waves are considered,
opening a  gap in the spectrum is even 
more difficult and it took several years of intensive
search to achieve it experimentally for microwaves \cite{YGL}.
Note that Maxwell's equations enjoy scale invariance so that, in principle,
by scaling all sizes of a given structure one can shift 
a gap theoretically to whatever frequency range. 

So far, the plane-wave method \cite{ZS,HCS,SHI,SY,BSS} has been the main tool 
to calculate  the spectrum of electromagnetic waves in three-dimensional 
dielectric lattices. However, the plane-wave method is numerically
rather unstable for a setup considered
in experiment, namely when the dielectric function is piece-wise
constant and changes discontinuously \cite{YGL,As,WV}.
The main culprit for this behaviour is the
Gibbs instability - the dielectric constant is poorly
estimated near its spatial discontinuities by a truncated Fourier series
which wildly oscillates
even if more than one thousand  of plane waves is retained
(see, for example, figure 2 of \cite{SHI}).
Also, the plane wave expansion becomes impractical if the dielectric
constant exhibits a large imaginary part. 
Another approach to calculate the spectrum 
of electromagnetic waves in three-dimensional 
dielectric lattices uses a discretization of Maxwell's equation
inside the primitive cell of the lattice \cite{Pen}

The bureau estimates that compliance with the added regulations will cost the deepwater industry $183 million a year, largely for changes in well design and the requirement that operators maintain subsea robots to operate blowout preventers in case primary control systems fail.

Although the suspension of the moratorium takes effect immediately, offshore operators will first have to submit new applications showing they have complied with the tougher rules and have their rigs inspected. Officials said they expect at least some of the rigs to be drilling again by the end of the year, although they are uncertain about when the first permit might be cleared.

“We are open for business,” Mr. Salazar said. Still, the opening of business may be delayed by a shortage of government manpower for reviewing applications and performing inspections, federal officials acknowledged.

The moratorium was scheduled to expire on Nov. 30, but the administration came under intense pressure to lift it sooner as companies began laying off workers, oil industry support businesses suffocated, and several rigs moved out of the gulf or were taken out of service. Two federal courts ruled that the moratorium was illegal, but it stayed in place as the government appealed the decisions.

Economists and oil industry supporters said the moratorium could cost billions of dollars in lost income and force thousands of layoffs. Yet the worst of the predicted economic impacts have not been felt, as oil companies have continued to pay their most valuable workers and the spill cleanup created thousands of temporary jobs.

The suspension affected 33 deepwater drilling rigs, but that number has shrunk to about two dozen now awaiting new permits to go back to work.

The initial reaction to the decision was mixed, with environmentalists saying it endangered the gulf and the oil industry complaining that the new rules mean the ban will effectively continue.

FARMINGTON HILLS (WWJ) – Police have suspended a manhunt in Farmington Hills after the victim’s story didn’t add up.

Officers were searching Tuesday for a gunman after an 18-year-old man was shot at apartment complex at the Hunters Ridge Apartments and Townhomes, a gated community along 14 Mile, just west of Orchard Lake Road.

Officers arriving at the scene early Tuesday morning were told by the victim that he knew the shooter and that the shooter had already fled in a vehicle.

Some Bloomfield Hills schools in the area were put into “secure mode” as the victim, who police say was not a student, was rushed to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

West Bloomfield police officers were aiding in the search for the suspect who authorities described as armed and dangerous.

Police later said, in a statement, that an investigation revealed the victim’s story was inconsistent with some of the evidence discovered at the scene. Therefore, police ceased their search and were exploring the possibility that the victim may have accidentally shot himself on the way to work.

The victim was in surgery Tuesday afternoon. His name has not been released.

An investigation is ongoing.

Anyone with information is asked to call the Farmington Hills Police Department at 248- 871-2610

An Open letter to Senator Manchin

From user jratcliff63367

My Open Letter to the Senator:

I appreciate your concern for the citizens of this country, but I am afraid that you may have a deep lack of understanding of the technology underlying bitcoin.

A few things you should be aware of.

(1) Bitcoin is a protocol, not a currency per-se. It is a way to transmit information over the Internet and that information can represent ‘value’ if the sender chooses to treat it that way. From a technical standpoint, it actually cannot be shut down without shutting down the Internet itself.

(2) This technology/protocol cannot be un-invented. It has already been copied thousands of times and is replicated all over the world in multiple forms. Banning bitcoin is like trying to ban email, twitter, or text messages. It’s really not practical.

(3) Bitcoin is already being regulated by the US government. All exchanges which convert bitcoins into US dollars and back are under strict regulatory requirements.

(4) Bitcoin works off of an open source public ledger that is 100% transparent. It does not come even close to representing a significant problem for law enforcement more than cash does today; this isn’t just my opinion this is what was said at recent Senate hearings on the topic. It is important to remember that, of course, more illegal activity is done with the US dollar by orders upon orders of magnitude greater than ever has been done with bitcoin. Yes, criminals try to use bitcoins for illegal activities, just as criminals will try to exploit any value system, but they have been caught, repeatedly, and shut down. We don’t make the US dollar illegal simply because criminals use it. We don’t shut down the Internet, and email, and text messages, because criminals use it either. Likewise, shutting down bitcoin (which technically can’t even be done) makes about as much sense.

(5) Many people in government and the technology industry have been steadily working together to create a better regulatory environment for this powerful technology which could change the world of finance and lift untold millions out of poverty.

(6) Our existing financial system uses ancient 1950’s technology simply to transmit value around

However, there are also several challenges such as volatility, lack of widespread acceptance, and concerns over its energy consumption. Nonetheless, continued development and improvements could address these issues and further enhance the usefulness of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
Answer:1. Increased transparency
Bitcoin operates on a public ledger, providing a transparent record of all transactions. This can help reduce corruption and fraud by making it more difficult to hide illicit activities. Additionally, the decentralized nature of Bitcoin eliminates the need for third-party intermediaries, which can lead to a more efficient and transparent system.
2. Lower transaction fees
As a digital currency, Bitcoin eliminates the need for banks and other financial institutions to process transactions. This can potentially reduce transaction fees for consumers and businesses alike, making it more cost-effective to send and receive payments.
3. Faster international payments
Cross-border transactions can take days or even weeks to process using traditional methods. Bitcoin, on the other hand, enables near-instant transactions across borders, reducing the time and cost associated with international payments.

As a digital currency, Bitcoin eliminates the need for banks and other financial institutions to process transactions. This can potentially reduce transaction fees for consumers and businesses alike, making it more cost-effective to send and receive payments.
3. Faster international payments
Cross-border transactions can take days or even weeks to process using traditional methods. Bitcoin, on the other hand, enables near-instant transactions across borders, reducing the time and cost associated with international payments.

Question:What are some potential challenges that may hinder the widespread adoption of Bitcoin as a currency?

 Some potential challenges that may hinder the widespread adoption of Bitcoin as a currency include its volatility, regulatory uncertainties, lack of mainstream acceptance, and concerns over energy consumption. The fluctuating value of Bitcoin can make it less appealing for everyday transactions, while regulatory frameworks vary across countries, creating uncertainty for businesses and users. Additionally, the limited acceptance of Bitcoin by merchants and service providers limits its usability as a widely accepted form of payment. Finally, the energy-intensive process of mining Bitcoin raises environmental concerns and could potentially impact its long-term sustainability.

Question:Q: Can Bitcoin transactions be reversed?
The blockchain in Bitcoin is designed to ensure that once a transaction is verified and added to the network, it cannot be reversed. This is due to the use of a locking mechanism that ensures the coins are not spent twice. In theory, if a mistake is made during the transaction, the sender could create a new transaction to send the coins back, but this would require the sender and the recipient to agree to the reversal, and the recipient would need to return the coins to the sender's address.

Question:What are some of the specific ways that Apple aims to minimize the impact of the new building on the surrounding trees? Is there a particular method or approach that they intend to use to ensure minimal disruption to the trees?
Answer:When designing the new building in Cupertino, Apple prioritized minimizing the impact on the surrounding trees. To achieve this, they employed several strategies that were carefully considered during the building's construction.
One of the key approaches was to carefully survey the site before construction began. The arborist from Stanford conducted a thorough tree assessment, which allowed the design team to identify which trees were essential to preserve. This information was then used to create a construction plan that minimized disturbance to these trees.
During construction, Apple implemented a number of measures to protect the trees. For example, they used a localized ground penetrating radar system to avoid drilling or digging too close to the roots of the trees. This minimized the risk of damaging the roots, which could otherwise harm the trees' health.
The construction team also used a precise excavation technique called "micro-tunneling" for the

\section{Introduction}
There is a growing interest in the so called data science. Modern computers and clever algorithms have made possible to deal with massive amount of data and extract information for making more and more sophisticated models and predictions. The magic words are ``deep learning'' or ``machine learning''. These are fancy words to denote a set of tools that comprise linear algebra, calculus, statistics and optimization. Employers demand deep learning experts so for physics students some basic knowledge would be of interest. Here we present a problem which serves to introduce the student in those techniques of scientific computing while keeping the interest in physics topics. It is inspired on the celebrated paper ``Of flying frogs and levitrons'' \cite{Berry285} which has been the guiding idea for the design of a levitating device to explore superfluity regimes \cite{Arr21}. 

In order to levitate diamagnetic materials, it is crucial to find the stability region of a given magnetic field configuration. The problem reduces to identify the place where the energy of the system obtains a minimum. To achieve levitation the total force on the object must vanish thus the gradient of the energy should be zero. However that condition is not enough, we also need to impose that the Laplacian of the energy will be positive, so the equilibrium is stable. Solving the problem involves to get the magnetic fields, and their derivatives, mostly in forms of gradients and Hessians. Here is where some techniques of machine learning are applied, in particular automatic differentiation (AD) which is at the heart of deep learning \cite{Baydin18}. 

We will study the particular case of finding the stability region in the field created by a circular current loop. The problem presented here gives us an extra bonus: the elliptic functions. There are available ready-to-try packages (both free and commercial) for deep learning applications ranging from image and speech recognition, genome-based taxonomic classification, drug research and so on. Normally the standard functions used in these packages are limited to a set of basic functions, like the sigmoids \cite{Higham19}. When considering the magnetic field created by a circular loop we will be dealing with elliptic functions

\section{Introduction}

Restricted dimensionality in many-body systems gives rise to phenomena associated with strong fluctuations and strong correlations between particles \cite{nagaosa1999quantum,giamarchi2004quantum,fradkin2013field}.
Among these systems of low dimensionality, one dimensional (1D) quantum systems, e.g., quantum wires such as carbon nanotubes \cite{avouris2008carbon,ishii2003direct,shi2015observation,sato2019strong,wang2020nonlinear}, 1D liquid $^{3}{\rm He}$ and $^{4}{\rm He}$ \cite{wada2001helium,taniguchi2005possible,savard2011hydrodynamics,bertaina2016one}, and ultracold gases trapped in a 1D potential \cite{cazalilla2011one,wen2013fermi,capponi2016phases,stoferle2004transition,kinoshita2006a,citro2007evidence,widera2008quantum,haller2010pinning,hu2011detecting,gring2012relaxation,cheneau2012light,danshita2013universal,fabbri2015dynamical,kunimi2017thermally,yang2017quantum,ozaki2020semiclassical}, have offered a unique platform for exploring in and out of equilibrium many-body phenomena that cannot be captured within naive mean-field treatments due to significant quantum and thermal fluctuations.

A unifying property observed in generic gapless boson and fermion systems in 1D is that the low-lying excitations of the spectrum are dominated by collective bosonic excitations \cite{tomonaga1950remarks,luttinger1963exactly,mattis1965exact,cazalilla2004bosonizing}.
This property can be universally described by Tomonaga--Luttinger liquid (TLL) theory that is established by linearization of the microscopic band structure and bosonization relations \cite{nagaosa1999quantum,giamarchi2004quantum,fradkin2013field,gogolin2004bosonization,haldane1981effective,furusaki1994kondo,cazalilla2004bosonizing,mathey2004luttinger,mathey2007commensurate,tokuno2008dynamics,kitagawa2010ramsey,eggel2011dynamical,ruhman2015topological,okamoto2016hierarchical,ashida2016quantum,matveev2017second,matveev2018hybrid,imamura2019from}.
In TLL theory, a harmonic fluid Hamiltonian, referred to as the TL Hamiltonian, arises as a low-energy effective model of a microscopic system. Important examples include 1D spinless fermions, dilute Bose gases in 1D, and various spin one-half chains \cite{giamarchi2004quantum,gogolin2004bosonization}.
The central dynamical fields of the TL formalism are the collective variables ${\hat \theta}(x)$ and ${\hat \phi}(x)$, which correspond to the phase and density fluctuations of a single-component system \cite{haldane1981effective}.
In terms of these fields, the TL Hamiltonian is written as \cite{giamarchi2004quantum,haldane1981effective}   
\begin{align}
{\hat H}_{0} = \frac{\hbar v_0}{2\pi}\int dx \left[ K (\partial_{x}{\hat \theta})^2 + \frac{1}{K} (\partial_x {\hat \phi})^2 \right]. \label{eq: tll model}
\end{align}
Here $v_0$ is the zero-temperature sound velocity and $K$ is the TL parameter controlling the correlations of the system. 
The canonical variables satisfy the commutation relation $[{\hat \phi}(x),\partial_{x'}{\hat \theta}(x')]=i\pi \delta(x-x')$ \cite{giamarchi2004quantum}.
The TL Hamiltonian also emerges as a renormalization group fixed point in the scaling limit of quantum critical systems, and defines the concept of gapless TLL phases \cite{sachdev2011quantum}.
In the standard treatment of TLL theory, in order to evaluate physical quantities, Eq.~(\ref{eq: tll model}) is diagonalized by using a Bogoliubov transformation for ${\hat \phi}$ and ${\hat \theta}$ \cite{haldane1981effective,giamarchi2004quantum}.
Then, within the harmonic-fluid approximation, the system is decomposed into free bosons ${\hat H}_0 \rightarrow \sum_{k \neq 0}\hbar \omega_{k} {\hat b}^{\dagger}_{k}{\hat b}_{k}$, where $\omega_{k}=v_0|{k}|$ is the linear dispersion.
Due to this exact solvability, key quantities, such as the local magnetization or spatiotemporal correlation functions, can be evaluated analytically.

Schematic illustration of the squeezed-field description for the TL Hamiltonian.
(a) In the standard TLL description, the vacuum energy functional, whose value is determined from an equilibrium Bogoliubov-transformation angle, is static and elementary excitations of the vacuum are non-interacting bosons.
(b) In the squeezed-field description, crudely speaking, the vacuum energy functional is allowed to breathe around an equilibrium state.
As a consequence, the bosons are scattered by fluctuations of the energy functional, giving rise to an effective coupling between $k$ and $-k$ modes

Question:What role does the study of fluctuations play in understanding the emergence of the superfluid phase in a Bose-Einstein condensate?
Answer:How does the non-local interaction, resulting from the spatially varying correlations in the energy functional, contribute to the emergence of superfluidity in a Bose-Einstein condensate?

 The non-local interaction, which couples $k$ and $-k$ modes, plays a crucial role in the emergence of superfluidity. It allows for the exchange of momentum between different regions of the condensate, enabling coherent flow without dissipation. This non-local coupling is a consequence of the effective action derived from studying fluctuations around the equilibrium state and provides a bridge between the disordered potential and the collective behavior of the bosons.

Question:Q: Can you further explain how the concept of disorder in the potential landscape influences the behavior of Bose-Einstein condensates and the role of the Dawson statistic in characterizing these fluctuations?
Answer:The concept of disorder in the potential landscape can significantly influence the behavior of Bose-Einstein condensates. In the provided text, the disordered potential arises from the random scatterers that the Bosons interact with. This disorder breaks the translational symmetry of an ideal Bose gas and gives rise to spatially varying correlations in the energy functional.

To understand the concept of vortices in superfluidity, let's first define what superfluidity is. Superfluidity is a state of matter where a fluid exhibits unusual properties, such as the ability to flow without any viscosity or resistance. This means that superfluids can flow through tiny openings and can maintain their shape even when the flow is significantly disturbed.
Now, let's talk about vortices in this context. A vortex is a region where the fluid's flow is rotating around a central axis. In the case of superfluids, vortices can arise due to an instability in the system. This instability causes the fluid to rotate around a central axis, creating a vortex.

On Christmas Eve in 2009, Ezekiel Gilbert paid an escort he found on Craigslist $150 for what he thought would be sex. Instead, according to the San Antonio Express-News, 23-year-old Lenora Frago left his apartment after about 20 minutes without consummating the act. Gilbert, now 30, followed her to a car with a gun and shot her in the neck through the passenger-side window. Frago became paralyzed, and died about seven months later. Gilbert admitted to shooting her but contended that he did not intend to kill.

Gilbert was tried for murder. Last Wednesday, a Texas jury ruled that his actions were legal. That’s because Texas penal code contains an unusual provision that grants citizens the right to use deadly force to prevent someone “who is fleeing immediately after committing burglary, robbery, aggravated robbery, or theft during the nighttime from escaping with the property.”

Texas A&M Professor Mark Hoekstra, who studies the effectiveness of lethal-force provisions in self-defense law, says the protection-of-property element of the deadly force law is “pretty unique to Texas.” Within Texas, however, the case was not unique. In 2010, the law protected a Houston taco-truck owner who shot a man for stealing a tip jar containing $20.12. Also in Houston, a store clerk recently killed a man for shoplifting a twelve-pack of beer, and in 2008 a man from Laredo was acquitted for killing a 13-year-old boy who broke into his trailer looking for snacks and soda.

Texas law also justifies killing to protect others’ property. In 2007, a man told 14 times by a 911 operator to remain inside during a robbery gunned down two thieves fleeing from his neighbor’s house. (“There’s no property worth shooting somebody over, OK?” the operator said on the call. The shooter’s response: “The law has been changed….Here it goes, buddy! You hear the shotgun clickin’ and I’m goin’!”) He was acquitted the next year.

So-called “justifiable homicides” are on the rise in Texas, where in 2007 Governor Rick Perry expanded already expansive lethal-force laws to allow Texans to kill in their vehicles and workplaces in self-defense or in any location to stop “aggravated kidnapping, murder, sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault, robbery, or aggravated robbery.” Though the penal code has included the clause discussing “theft during the nighttime” since the 1970s, some Texans might have taken the 2007 change as a declaration of open season. From 2002 to 2006, there were 146 cases of justifiable homicide committed by private citizens. From 2007 to 2011, the number jumped to 224, an increase of more than 50%.

Such cases have often drawn outrage and prompted communities to question the state’s lethal-force laws. Proponents of lethal force in cases of self-defense say that crime rates have fallen in response to the laws. But a study conducted by Hoekstra and his colleague Cheng Cheng found that overall homicide numbers rose in the 21 states that adopted such laws between 2000 and 2010.

Chandler McClellan and Erdal Tekin, who study lethal force at the National Bureau of Economic Research, conducted research that confirmed Hoekstra and Cheng’s results. “To the extent Gilbert’s acquittal depended on a defense of justifiable homicide,” they wrote, “the result is consistent with the notion that such force may not have been used except for the liberalization of laws meant to prevent homicide. Further, this acquittal could indicate to others that the use of lethal force is acceptable under a broad set of circumstances, thereby resulting in more violence. While the expansion of self-defense laws has slowed in the wake of recent high-profile cases such as Trayvon Martin, there have been no concerted efforts to roll back these laws or establish stricter standards

Question:Can you explain why you think the increase in justifiable homicides did not lead to a reduction in overall homicide rates, according to the 2014 study?
Answer:Q. What factors could explain the lack of reduction in overall homicide rates despite the increase in justifiable homicides in Texas from 2007 to 2011, as indicated by the 2014 study?

 Several factors could contribute to this phenomenon. One possibility is that the increase in justifiable homicides may not have directly deterred potential criminals or reduced their willingness to engage in violent behavior.

\section{Introduction}
Deep learning as such is based on the idea that concatenations of (suitably chosen) nonlinear functions increase expressivity so that complex pattern modeling and recognition problems can be solved. While initial approaches such as AlexNet \citep{alexnet} only used moderate depth, improvements such as batch normalization \cite{batchnorm,bn_covshift,bn_autotune} or residual connections \cite{resnet} made the training of networks with hundreds or even thousands of layers possible, and this did contribute to significant practical gains.

From a theoretical perspective, a networks depth (along with its width) is known to upper bound the complexity of the function that it can represent \citep{vc_bounds} and therefore upper bounds the networks expressivity. Indeed, deeper networks are found to enhance performance \citep{efficientnet}, but gains seem to taper off and saturate with increasing depth. Very deep networks are also known to be more difficult to analyze  \citep{generalization}, more computationally expensive to train or infer and suffer from numerous stability issues such as vanishing \citep{vanishing_gradients}, exploding \citep{fixup} and shattering \citep{shattering_gradients} gradients. Similar arguments can be made about layer width: a sufficiently large network can memorize any given function \citep{original_uat}, but under standard initialization and training infinite width networks degrade to Gaussian processes \cite{Jacot2018}.

From a practical perspective, there are now many successful recipes for creating networks of a prescribed depth, but it is still difficult to understand -- empirically or analytically -- how many nonlinear layers and features per layer are actually needed to solve a problem, and how effective a chosen architecture actually is in exploiting its expressive potential in the sense of a deep stack of concatenated nonlinear computations.

Our paper addresses this question from an empirical perspective: we use a very simple setup that associates every nonlinear unit with a cost at channel granularity, which can be raised continuously, while simultaneously trying to maintain performance. This is done by replacing each ReLU layer with channel-wise PReLU activations \citep{prelu} and regularizing their slopes towards linearity. Such a linearized feature channel therefore only forms linear combinations of existing feature channels, thereby not effectively contributing to the nonlinear complexity of the network. Observing the partially linearized network can tell us \textit{how many} nonlinear units are needed by a given network and also \textit{where} they are needed. We measure the average amount of nonlinear units a given input traverses until it is classified disregarding subsequent linear mappings along computational paths, as these do not increase expressivity in a nonlinear sense. 

Using tool, we make a series of experiments on common convolutional network architectures on standard computer vision tasks by partially linearizing networks after regular training, make the following observations:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The amount of nonlinear units in the network can be reduced considerably before suffering larger performance losses and where the transition occurs depends on the difficulty of the task to learn.
	\item The average amount of nonlinear units encountered along a path in the computation graph ("effective depth") of the resulting networks is very low before performance collapses.
	\item When applying the same regularization strength to networks of varying width and depth, the effective width and depth is similar for all resulting partially linearized networks for a fixed task.
	\item A network partially linearized at a later stage of training outperforms the same network partially linearized earlier. The biggest difference is notable in the early training phase.
\end{itemize}
These findings indicate, consistent with earlier hypothesis \citep{lottery} that there is a core nonlinear structure in networks that forms during the first epochs of training whose shape depends on the task to solve and is largely independent of the shape of initial network chose.
\section{Related Work}
\iffalse

A lot of work has been done to understand the implications of depth on expressivity, generalization performance and the function classes that can be learned efficiently. The well-known universal approximation theorem \citep{original_uat} shows that a network with only one layer but sufficient width is able to ``memorize'' any function. Indirectly, this might suggests that the generalization capabilities of neural networks might be tightly linked to their depth. In this spirit, \citet{narrow_uat} reformulate the well-known universal approximation theorem \citep{original_uat} for deep and narrow networks; \citep{debauchies} are studying what class of functions can be effectively approximated by deep ReLU networks

Answer:Sure! The question is "Q. In what ways does network training help us understand what kind of data an AI agent will need to perform well?"

1. Network training is a way of helping an AI agent understand what kind of data it needs to perform well. When we train a neural network on labeled training data, we are demonstrating to the network how the input data should look like, based on its expected performance. By doing so, the network learns to pay attention to meaningful features contained within the data, and ignores those that are not necessary for making accurate predictions. This process helps the network to focus on the most relevant and important aspects of the data, facilitating its performance improvement.

2. Network training makes the AI model perform well because it helps the network establish a strong representation of the data, providing the foundation needed

Given the heightened tensions on the borders, a plan to provide upgraded technology to India’s forces on the border couldn’t have come at a more opportune moment.

After a nod from the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Border Security Force (BSF) has kick-started installation of a unique, indigenously designed virtual fencing system — Comprehensive Integrated Border Management System (CIBMS) — at two places in Jammu. The system is expected to go operational by March 2018.

“Our main thrust is to bring a sea change in guarding our borders by integrating latest technology and equipment. We’re putting up two pilot projects under CIBMS in Jammu, which is unique in the world for guarding borders. Work order has been awarded and it’s expected to go operational by March 2018,” the director general of BSF, KK Sharma, told Firstpost.

CIBMS is an integration of highly sophisticated equipment — like handheld thermal imager (HHTI), night vision devices (NVD), long-range radars, battlefield surveillance radars, etc — with manpower. It’s a virtual fencing system.

It will be a shot in the arm of the Border Security Force (BSF) – the world’s largest border force – that is engaged in guarding India's land border, with challenges such as infiltration of terrorists across the border into Kashmir and eastern states like West Bengal and Assam, and drug and cattle smuggling, among others.

How will CIBMS function?

— Thermal imager indicates body heat signatures of any living being that moves towards Indian boundaries in the dark of the night at a distance of 3 km.

— NVD, long-range radars, battlefield surveillance radars, etc catch slightest of vibrations at shorter distances.

— Indigenously-developed infra-red intruder alarm, not visible through naked eye, alerts the BSF personnel. Anyone crossing the invisible infra-red wall within 700-metre range will get caught.

— Analytical tools identify suspicious movements and distinguish between man and animal from the shadow.

— Finally, based on inputs received, intruders (infiltrators or terrorists) will be eliminated.

— Motion sensors have been included in CIBMS to save power and reduce electricity bill of Rs 90-100 crore (due to flood lights on borders).

Under the pilot project, two CIBMS will be installed for a length of 5 km each. Once it’s successfully implemented, a similar system will be replicated at other places to protect the border.

“At present, some of these equipments are in the hands of jawans posted on the borders and the possibility of human error can’t be ruled out. But once this system becomes operational, it will be the latest in India on border-guarding, with the least human error. Israel was the first to have this system in place. We’ve the proposal to install CIBMS along Jammu and Punjab bordering Pakistan. Our emphasis is also to plug the riverine gaps and there’s a proposal to have this system installed at Dhubri district in Assam,” Sharma said.

Besides thwarting Pakistan’s constant attempt to push militants through the border into India, like it did last at Nagrota in Jammu and Kashmir on 29 November 2016, countering narcotics and cattle smugglers is another big challenge for the BSF.

Not known to many, the terrorists across the border attacked the army base camp at Nagrota and killed seven army personnel. On the same night at a distance, when three other terrorists were making their way through a tunnel, the BSF tracked and neutralised them.

Despite severe constraints, the cattle smuggling, which is a complex issue due to geopolitical reasons, has declined from 20 lakh per annum in 2013 to less than 6 lakh in 2017 (as on date), with record seizure of animals in 2016.

“Bangladesh border is 4,096 km long, out of which about 950 km is unfenced due to riverine belt. It’s humanly not possible to cover this unfenced stretch. Smuggling takes place through this porous stretch, despite our patrolling and floodlights

In my first week as a reference librarian in the Prints and Photographs Division of the Library of Congress, I was told by several colleagues that it takes at least a decade to get to know the collection. No wonder: P&P’s collections contain nearly 16 million items.

A noteworthy number of those items are stored in the reading room. Having worked in five other special collections libraries, all of them with closed stacks, I was amazed to find that the Prints and Photographs Division reading room has actual collection material in it and— with some guidance from reading room staff— patrons are permitted to browse through it. What a revelation!

Take the Specific Subject File (SSF), which makes available some 20,000 photographs from various sources. Some of the contents have been digitized as researchers have purchased copies, but looking in the file lets you appreciate qualities of the digitized and un-digitized photos, alike.

Because it’s organized by subject, the Specific Subject File is suited to topical browsing. Does fickle weather have you alternately thinking about a trip to the beach and a dusting of snow?

Researching the long history of protest in American cities? There is no shortage of such images in the Specific Subject File, though you may need to look in more than one place.

The connections among the reading room files are endless. For example, you can find images of Washington, D.C. in several different collections in the reading room.

Τhe Stereograph File reveals some aspects of life in our capital city that you’ve probably never pondered. Ever thought about the quality control work that went into producing paper money in the early twentieth century? Well, here you have a visual representation.

Browse the biographical section of the Stereograph File and you might find stylized depictions of famous Americans, including John Brown and Frederick Douglass.

Four stereograph viewers are available for reading room visitors to view these images in 3-D. Simply insert the stereograph into the viewer, look through the lenses and— voila!— you will be transported to another time and place.

Walk over to the U.S

\section*{Introduction}

As cooperation is costly, an individual is better off not cooperating. This leads to a tragedy of the commons where everyone ends up being worse off than if otherwise, all had cooperated \cite{Hardin}. However, contrary to what a rational argument suggests, empirical evidence shows that tragedies of the commons are not that common in nature \cite{Boyd}. Over the past decades, many efforts have been devoted to understanding how evolution has prevented tragedies of the commons and promoted high levels of cooperation \cite{Boyd,Axelrod,Nowak,Perc2013}. Prisoner's dilemma, and its extension to $n$ players, public goods game (PGG), have been the most common frameworks in many of these studies \cite{Doebeli,Axelrod,Nowak,Perc2013,Axelrod}. In the latter game, each player in a group of $n$ players can decide whether to invest an amount $c$ in a public good or not. All the investments are multiplied by an enhancement factor $r<n$ and are divided equally among the players. Defectors, refraining from investment, receive the highest payoff and are expected to dominate the population. This expectation contradicts observation \cite{Boyd,Axelrod}. Past researches have revealed different mechanisms through which this puzzle can be solved. For instance, when interactions are repeated, cooperation can evolve due to the threat of retaliation of a defective act in future rounds \cite{Hilbe2018a,Axelrod,Schmid2021}. However, in many cases, interactions are not repeated. A similar mechanism, indirect reciprocity \cite{Milinski,Panchanathan,Schmid2021,Alexander2017}, based on which an individual's reputation determines others' behavior towards the individual can be at work to promote cooperation in non-repeated interactions. Similarly, punishment of defectors \cite{Fehr,Perc,Boyd2,Szolnoki,Hauert1,Hilbe2,Salahshour2,Salahshour2021B} or rewarding cooperators \cite{Rand,Attila,Hilbe} can promote social behavior. Cooperation can also evolve when interactions are not obligatory \cite{Hauert,Szabo}, or when individuals have a choice between different institutions \cite{Salahshour0,Salahshour2021A}. Furthermore, it is shown that the very existence of population structure can promote cooperation due to the assortativity of interactions in structured populations \cite{Ohtsuki2006,Perc2013}. Other studies have shown assortativity \cite{Iyer2020}, for instance resulting from kin selection, group selection \cite{Nowak} or tag-based mechanisms \cite{Riolo2001}, social diversity \cite{Qin,Santos}, heterogeneity \cite{Perc2011,Stilwell2020,Kun2013}, conformity \cite{Hu2019,Szolnoki2015}, costly signaling \cite{Salahshour1,Gintis}, moral norms \cite{Salahshour2021C,Alexander2017}, and coevolution of cooperation and language \cite{Salahshour2020}, to mention a few, can play a positive role in the evolution of cooperation.

Despite the valuable insights reached on the subject, open questions regarding the mechanisms and conditions under which cooperative behavior is expected to flourish, remain to be addressed. A curious question in this regard is the existence of consistent cooperative and defective personalities. For instance, public goods experiments have shown that while about half of the people are conditional cooperators who are willing to cooperate provided their group-mates cooperate, others tend to free-ride on others' contributions \cite{Fischbacher1,Fischbacher2,Burlando,Chaudhuri}. Similar observations regarding consistent personality differences in humans and animals, in different contexts, have been made \cite{Bergmuller}. These observations raise the question of how such consistent cooperative and defective personality differences evolve, and if this can play a constructive role in the evolution of cooperation?

To gain a better insight into this question, here, I consider a context where individuals possibly play two consecutive PGGs. Individuals have independent strategies in the two PGGs. However, their strategy in the first PGG determines the PGG they enter for the second round

Answer Paraphrase: How do decisions made in one round of the Public Goods Game influence participation in the subsequent round?
Answer:Decisions made in one round of the Public Goods Game can affect participation in the following round through several mechanisms:
1. Selection: Individuals who cooperate (contributing more to the common pool) in the first round may be more likely to participate in the second round, as they may have a higher chance of being selected based on their performance in the first round.
2. Strategy adjustment: Individuals may change their strategies in response to the outcomes of the first round. For example, defectors may become more cooperative if they observe that cooperative behavior leads to better outcomes for the group.
3. Social learning: Individuals may learn from the actions of others in the first round and adjust their strategies accordingly in the second round. This can be through direct observation or indirect learning from the payoff matrix.

Question:Can you provide an example of a situation where indirect learning from the payoff matrix could occur? How might this impact the formation of reputation in a population of players?
Answer:Q. How can the evolution of consistent cooperative and defective personalities impact the overall level of cooperation in a population?
 The evolution of consistent cooperative and defective personalities can have a significant impact on the overall level of cooperation in a population. If cooperative individuals are more likely to interact with other cooperators, they can form cooperative clusters that promote cooperation within their group. This clustering effect can create pockets of high cooperation, increasing the overall level of cooperation in the population. On the other hand, if defectors tend to interact with other defectors, this can lead to the formation of defective clusters that undermine cooperation. The presence of both cooperative and defective personalities allows for diversity in strategies and may contribute to maintaining a dynamic equilibrium between cooperation and defection in a population.

3. Social learning: Individuals may learn from the actions of others in the first round and adjust their strategies accordingly in the second round. This can be through direct observation or indirect learning from the payoff matrix.
4. Reputation formation: Individuals who consistently cooperate or defect
Question:Can you provide an example of a situation where indirect learning from the payoff matrix could occur? How might this impact the formation of reputation in a population of players?
Answer:Q. How can the evolution of consistent cooperative and defective personalities impact the overall level of cooperation in a population?
 The evolution of consistent cooperative and defective personalities can have a significant impact on the overall level of cooperation in a population. If cooperative individuals are more likely to interact with other cooperators, they can form cooperative clusters that promote cooperation within their group. This clustering effect can create pockets of high cooperation, increasing the overall level of cooperation in the population. On the other hand, if defectors tend to interact with other defectors, this can lead to the formation of defective clusters that undermine cooperation. The presence of both cooperative and defective personalities allows for diversity in strategies and may contribute to maintaining a dynamic equilibrium between cooperation and defection in a population.

Question:Key takeaways from the text include:
1. Decisions made in one round of the Public Goods Game can affect participation in the subsequent round through mechanisms such as selection, strategy adjustment, social learning, and reputation formation.
2. Consistent cooperative and defective personalities can have a profound impact on the overall level of cooperation in a population, influencing the formation of cooperative and defective clusters, and contributing to maintaining a dynamic equilibrium between cooperation and defection.
3. Understanding these dynamics can provide insights into the evolution of cooperation and the role of individual personality differences in shaping cooperative behavior.

Answer:1. What are the main concepts in the evolutionary stable strategy model?
The Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS) model is a mathematical approach to predicting the behavior of rational individuals in a game-theoretic setting. It is used to study the evolution of cooperative behavior in social dilemmas, such as the Prisoner's Dilemma. The main concepts of the ESS model are the strategy, payoff, and the notion of an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS).
1. What is a strategy in the ESS model?
A strategy is the decision-making rule that an individual follows in a game. In the context of the ESS model, a strategy is a choice made by an individual that determines their actions in a specific game, such as cooperating (C) or defecting (D) in the Prisoner's Dilemma.

Question:Based on the previous questions and context, here's a relevant and insightful question:

"How might the formation of reputation and the dynamics of cooperator-defector clusters influence the evolution of consistent cooperative and defective personalities in a population, and what implications might this have for the overall level of cooperation in the population?"

It might look like a walkie talkie, but that little box is more powerful than you think. When a cell phone jammer is turned on it can block any cell phone service in the area. Using one isn't only a federal crime but it could result in a $16,000 fine and jail time.

But that didn't stop Eric, a man in Philadelphia, who was fed up with the chatty cell phone talkers on the SEPTA 44 bus. According to NBC 10 in Philadelphia, Eric would fire up that very jammer when he didn't want to hear the conversations.

"A lot of people are extremely loud, no sense of just privacy or anything. When it becomes a bother, that's when I screw on the antenna and flip the switch," Eric told NBC 10.

Eric claimed that he didn't know it was illegal to block a cell phone signal, and thought it was a "gray area." He said he was under the impression that it was only illegal when blocking television or radio signals.

But even so, he wasn't very apologetic about his actions.

"I guess I'm taking the law into my own hands and, quite frankly, I'm proud of it," he told NBC 10.

Jammers like the one used in this case are illegal for reasons including that they could prevent cell phone communication in emergencies and because they can block other important signals such as police radio and other two-way radios.

Since finding out it is illegal, Eric said he planned to dispose of the jammer he bought, which ABC News estimated cost $300.

But the bigger issue is that Eric isn't alone in this jamming practice.

Jammers are easy to buy at sites like phonejammer.com and jammerall.com, and Forbes reported that others in the New Jersey and New York area are using them, as well

\section{Introduction}

At the International Linear Collider (ILC) \cite{ILC-TDR-Physics}, the 
electron-positron beam will collide at $250~\mathrm{GeV}$ in 
the center-of-mass frame.
A possible option of upgrading it to higher energies is also being considered.
The golden channel at $250~\mathrm{GeV}$ gives the unique opportunity of 
detecting Higgs events even without looking at its decay\cite{Fuji}.
Higgs mass can be determined with excellent precision from the measurement of 
Z boson, decaying in leptons.
The physics studies aimed at the ILC have pushed the requirements for
its detectors to an unprecedented level.
These requirements include excellent momentum resolution and good particle 
identification \cite{ILC-TDR-Detector}.
The International Large Detector (ILD) \cite{ILC-TDR-Detector} is one of the 
two detector concepts for the ILC.
A Time Projection Chamber (TPC) \cite{TPC, TPC-Hilke} (Fig.~\ref{TPC}) has 
been foreseen as the central tracker of the ILD and is likely to be installed 
just around the vertex detectors to accomplish continuous $3\mathrm{D}$ 
tracking with high efficiency.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{Figure1.png}
\caption{Schematic of the TPC for the ILD \cite{ILC-TDR-Detector}.}
\label{TPC}
\end{figure}

The size of the planned ILD-TPC is $329~\mathrm{mm}$ for inner radius,
$1808~\mathrm{mm}$ for outer radius, and $2350\times2~\mathrm{mm}$
(divides two parts) in {\it{z}} direction \cite{ILC-TDR-Detector}.
The TPC is expected to be placed inside a magnetic field of $3.5~\mathrm{T}$.
Under these conditions, the ILD-TPC is projected to have the spatial 
resolution of less than \SI{100}{\micro\meter} and 2-hit resolution of 
less than $2~\mathrm{mm}$ \cite{ILC-TDR-Detector}.
The Linear Collider TPC (LCTPC) collaboration \cite{LCTPC} was formed to 
pursue the the design, development and test of a Large Prototype TPC (LPTPC) 
\cite{LPTPC, LPTPC-Peter-Scade}. 


The Micro-Pattern Gaseous Detectors (MPGDs) \cite{MPGD}, due to their wide 
variety of geometries and flexible operating parameters, become a common 
choice for tracking and triggering detectors.
The LCTPC collaboration has, therefore, investigated the use of MPGDs for 
the TPC readout\cite{MPGD-TPC}.
One of the main advantage of the MPGD-based redaout over the conventional 
wire-based amplification system is the fact that in the amplification
 region, $\vec{E}\times\vec{B}$ effects are small and do not affect the 
resolution.  


One of the most widely used MPGDs is Micro-MEsh Gaseous Structure (Micromegas) Detectors, invented by Y

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

At the center of galaxies, stars can draine into the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) 
due to two-body diffusion, resonant relaxation and dynamical friction (DF) with the surrounding 
material (mainly dark matter and gas) \cite[e.g.][]{hop06}. 
Compact objects (COs), such as stellar remnants and stellar mass black holes (stellar BHs) 
can inspiral into a SMBH and emit gravitational waves, which could be detected by the Laser 
Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) \cite[e.g.,][]{fin00,ama17}.


In the presence of accretion disks as those in active galactic nuclei (AGN), 
stars and COs can experience gravitational torques that can accelerate the radial migration 
towards the center \cite[e.g.,][]{arm02,koc11}.
COs may belong to the nuclear cluster \citep{mck11}
or may have formed inside the AGN star-forming disk \cite[e.g.,][]{lev07}.


Nuclear cluster COs may have prograde as well as retrograde orbits with respect to the AGN accretion 
disk. COs born in the star-forming disk are expected to move on prograde orbits.
Still, gravitational scattering between them or with other objects (including a SMBH binary companion) 
may excite large orbital eccentricities  \cite[e.g

Question:What can we learn from studying the dynamics of binary black hole mergers?

 Studying the dynamics of binary black hole mergers can provide valuable insights into various aspects such as the formation and evolution of massive black holes, gravitational wave generation, and testing general relativity under extreme conditions. By understanding these processes, scientists can gain a better understanding of how galaxies form and evolve over time.
Answer:What are the key factors that influence the dynamics of binary black hole mergers, and how do they impact the resulting gravitational waves emitted during these events?

 The dynamics of binary black hole mergers are influenced by several key factors, including the masses and spins of the black holes, the eccentricity of their orbits, and the presence of any surrounding matter or radiation. These factors can significantly affect the resulting gravitational waves, with implications for our ability to detect and interpret them. For example, the mass ratio and spin orientation of the black holes can alter the frequency and amplitude of the
Question:Q: How do the masses and spins of the black holes involved in a binary black hole merger influence the resulting gravitational waves?
A: The masses and spins of the black holes involved in a binary black hole merger significantly influence the resulting gravitational waves. The mass ratio and spin orientation of the black holes can alter the frequency and amplitude of the waves, providing valuable information that can be used to further understand these phenomena.
Paraphrased: The masses and spins of the black holes involved in the merger impact the gravitational waves emitted. These factors change the frequency and intensity of the waves, providing valuable information about these phenomena.
Answer:Thank you for your question! I'm happy to help you understand the impact of holes on gravitational waves.
Firstly, it's important to note that holes do not directly emit gravitational waves. Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of spacetime that are produced by the acceleration of massive objects, such as black holes or neutron stars.
However, the presence of holes can affect the propagation of gravitational waves in a few ways:
1. Effect on the source: The presence of holes can modify the motion of the objects producing the gravitational waves. For example, if a black hole is present in the system, it can affect the orbit of the objects around it, which in turn can change the frequency and intensity of the gravitational waves emitted.
2. Effect on the wave propagation: The curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of holes can also affect the propagation of gravitational waves.

Scientists have discovered that an extra dose of sleep is more than just a luxury - it provides an essential boost to brain power ahead of the working week.

Those who return to work on Monday morning refreshed from a long lie-in the day before perform better than those who spent less time in bed at the weekend, research has found.

A single lie-in is all that is required to replenish the brain and boost energy, alertness and attention span after a week of restricted sleep, the study showed.

But even 10 hours in bed may not be enough to restore those who regularly burn the candle at both ends – so they should lie in even longer.

The scientists also warned against staying up all night partying at the weekend, which they said would significantly impair a person's performance at work the following week.

Dr David Dinges, chief of the Division of Sleep and Chronobiology at the University of Pennsylvania, who led the study, said: "The additional hour or two of sleep in the morning after a period of chronic partial sleep loss has genuine benefits for continued recovery of behavioural alertness.

"The bottom line is that adequate recovery is important for coping with the effects of chronic sleep restriction on the brain."

The scientists conducted a sleep deprivation experiment on 159 healthy adults, with an average age of 30.

After two nights of 10 hours in bed, 142 participants were restricted to four hours in bed from 4am to 8am for five consecutive nights.

They were then allowed randomised doses of recovery sleep ranging from zero hours to 10 hours for per night. The other 17 participants spent 10 hours in bed on all nights.

Participants were asked to complete 30-minute computerised assessments every two hours while they were awake. Those whose sleep had been restricted were found to have a shortened attention span, impaired alertness and reduced reaction time. But their normal functions were restored after just one full night of sleep.

The study also showed that people who got no sleep at all after the period of sleep deprivation performed significantly worse than normal.

"This highlights the importance of avoiding all-night sleep deprivation following a period of restricted sleep," Dr Dinges said.

The study was published in the latest issue of the journal Sleep.

It comes after a separate study published in the same journal found that the optimum amount of sleep is seven hours per night.

The findings contradict the received wisdom that eight hours’ sleep provide the best start to the day.

The study of more than 30,000 adults found that cardiovascular disease – which includes heart attacks, strokes and angina attacks – is twice as high among those sleeping less than five hours a day, compared with those getting seven hours.

Those who slept nine hours or more also had a markedly increased risk

Question:Q: How can sleep deprivation affect emotional regulation and decision-making abilities?

A: Sleep deprivation can negatively impact emotional regulation and decision-making abilities. When we are not getting enough sleep, our brains struggle to process emotions and regulate mood effectively. This can lead to impulsive behavior, irritability, and poor judgment. Additionally, lack of sleep can impair our ability to make complex decisions, leading to poor decision-making choices. To improve emotional regulation and decision-making abilities, it is essential to prioritize sleep by creating a consistent sleep schedule, limiting caffeine intake, and engaging in relaxation activities before bedtime.

\section{Introduction}
Dark matter in the Universe and stars in galaxies behave like a self-gravitating collisionless fluid of which the dynamics can be described by the Vlasov-Poisson system : 
\begin{eqnarray}
\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot  \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial \mathbf{x}} -\dfrac{\partial \phi}{\partial \mathbf{x}} \cdot \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial \mathbf{v}} = 0, \label{eq:vlagen1} \\
\vartriangle \phi = 4 \pi G \rho = 4 \pi G \int f(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{v}, t) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{v}, \label{eq:vlagen2}
\end{eqnarray}
where $f(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{v}, t)$ is the phase-space density of the fluid at position $\mathbf{x}$, velocity $\mathbf{v}$ and time $t$, $\rho$ is the mass density and $\phi$ is the gravitational potential. 


A major issue when considering the dynamics of gravitational systems such as dark matter halos, elliptical galaxies or star clusters in the non collisional regime is to understand the main processes underlying the creation of the quasi-stationary states that build up after a number of dynamical times, for instance the universal profiles of dark matter halos \citep{NFW1,NFW2}. 

One way to relate initial to quasi-equilibrium state is to assume that the system reaches some maximum entropy state after a {\em violent relaxation} phase with strong mixing \citep{LyndenBell}. However, the maximum entropy approach is at best partly successful \citep[see, e.g.][and references therein]{Yamashiro1992,Arad2005, Arad2005b,Yamaguchi2008,Joyce2011} and the only way to improve the results is to introduce additional constraints and ad hoc ingredients \citep[see, e.g.][]{Hjorth2010,Pontzen2013,Carron2013}. Indeed, relaxation might be incomplete, or maximum entropy state might not even exist, although one can generalize the concept of entropy by introducing the more general concept of H-functions \citep{Tremaine1986}, for which there exist stationary points related to actual stable equilibria even if entropy maximum does not exist. 

Another popular alternative to try understanding the establishment of quasi-stationary profiles consists in investigating the subspace of self-similar solutions \citep[see, e.g.,][but this list is far from exhaustive]{fillmore84,bertschinger85,Henriksen1995,sikivie97,mohayaee06,alard13}. While it is difficult to actually demonstrate the onset of self-similarity, it seems to be a natural outcome of gravitational dynamics, at least in the absence of any characteristic scale. 
Although they exist as well in the warm case \citep[see, e.g.][]{Henriksen1995}, self-similar solutions have been mostly studied in the cold case, for which the phase-space distribution function is of zero initial velocity dispersion. In this configuration, a $D$-dimensional phase-space sheet evolves in $2D$ phase-space and builds up a spiral pattern.

The above approaches, along with perturbation theory in cosmological systems \citep[see, e.g.][]{ptreview}, provide some partial analytical framework to study the Vlasov-Poisson system. However, in general, these equations usually require a numerical approach, which consists in decomposing the phase-space distribution function on an ensemble of macro-particles interacting with one another with a softened gravitational force \citep[see, e.g.][for reviews on the subject]{1988csup

Question:What are the main challenges in understanding the creation of quasi-stationary states in the Vlasov-Poisson system, and how can alternative methods help address them?

 The main challenges in understanding the creation of quasi-stationary states in the Vlasov-Poisson system lie in the complex dynamics and non-linear nature of self-gravitating fluids. The violent relaxation phase, which occurs after a perturbation or disturbance, leads to the formation of quasi-stationary states that are difficult to analyze analytically due to their non-equilibrium nature.

One challenge is that the maximum entropy approach, commonly used to describe these systems, has limitations when it comes to capturing the intricate details of their evolution. This approach assumes that the system reaches a state of maximum disorder or entropy, but it may not fully account for all physical processes involved.

To address these challenges, alternative methods such as investigating self-similar solutions have been explored. Self-similar solutions assume that certain properties of the system remain invariant under scaling transformations. By studying these solutions, researchers can gain insights into the behavior and evolution of self-gravitating fluids.

While self-similar solutions provide a partial analytical framework for understanding quasi-stationary states, numerical approaches are typically required to obtain more accurate and detailed results. Numerical simulations allow for a more comprehensive exploration of the parameter space and can capture complex interactions between particles or fluid elements.

In summary, understanding the creation of quasi-stationary states in the Vlasov-Poisson system requires overcoming challenges related to complex dynamics and non-linear behavior. Alternative methods such as investigating self-similar solutions offer valuable insights, but numerical approaches remain crucial for obtaining a deeper understanding of these systems.

It is dawn in the Negev desert and Mahmud Kashua is saying his first prayers of the day - a gun by his side. Mahmud is one of a growing number of Israeli Arabs who have volunteered to serve in the army of the Jewish state.

"I consider myself an Arab and a Muslim but I also consider myself part of this country," Mahmud tells me during a break in live fire practice on the range. "It's our state and we have to give back, to help as much as we can to the state which protects us."

Over six months a BBC Arabic documentary team gained extraordinary access to the Gadsar - an all-Arab unit of 500 within the Israeli Defence Force. Ten times as many Israeli Arabs - Muslims and Christians - are joining the IDF compared to three years ago.

"Our mission is to enlist as many as we can," says Col Wajdi Sarhan, head of the IDF Minorities Unit. "We have a few hundred and we want to double that in the next year."

Twenty per cent of Israel's population is Arab but only about 1% of them serve in the army. Enlisting is controversial in many of their communities.

Hanin Zoabi is an Israeli Arab MP who identifies herself as Palestinian and is a fierce critic of the state.

"This small marginalised group that serves in the Israeli army which serves Israel against its people knows they are crossing a patriotic red line," she says.

"Ninety per cent of the Arabs who serve in the Israeli army don't have equality with Israelis. Israel does not need them to protect its security, it's a political issue - first to divide and rule."

'Serving the occupation'

We followed the Gadsar as it became the first Israeli Arab unit ever to serve on the occupied West Bank, home to 1.7 million fellow Arabs - Palestinians.

It is a tense time - in the past year, 37 Israelis have been killed in a wave of knife, gun and car-ramming attacks by Palestinians or Israeli Arabs.

Answer:What are some potential challenges that the international community may face in effectively contributing to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and promoting peace in the region?

 There are several potential challenges that the international community may encounter when attempting to contribute to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and promoting peace in the region. Firstly, deep-rooted historical grievances and narratives on both sides make it difficult to bridge the gap between Israel and Palestine. The lack of trust and willingness to compromise can hinder progress in negotiations. Secondly, geopolitical interests and alliances among major powers can complicate efforts for a neutral and unbiased approach towards mediation. Thirdly, ensuring sustained commitment from all parties involved over an extended period of time can be challenging, as political dynamics often shift, priorities change, and domestic pressures come into play. Fourthly, addressing issues such as settlements, borders, refugees, security arrangements, and Jerusalem require delicate negotiations where finding mutually acceptable solutions can be arduous. Lastly, navigating through differing interpretations of international law related to self-determination, occupation, and sovereignty adds another layer of complexity. Overcoming these challenges will require persistent diplomatic engagement, consensus-building efforts among diverse stakeholders, genuine commitment from all parties involved, and a focus on long-term sustainable solutions rather than short-term gains.

Answer:How can the international community effectively contribute to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and promoting peace in the region?

 The international community can play a crucial role in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and fostering peace in the region by taking several key steps. Firstly, diplomatic efforts should be intensified, with global powers actively engaging both Israel and Palestine to facilitate negotiations and encourage a peaceful resolution based on mutual recognition and compromise. Secondly, economic support should be provided to promote development and stability in the region, creating an environment conducive to peace. Thirdly, international organizations such as the United Nations should continue to advocate for a two-state solution, ensuring that both parties have their legitimate rights protected. Additionally, regional actors and neighboring countries can contribute by facilitating dialogue between Israel and Palestine, promoting confidence-building measures, and supporting initiatives aimed at de-escalation. Ultimately, a collective effort from the international community is necessary to address this complex conflict and pave the way for lasting peace in Israel and Palestine.
Question:What are the key factors contributing to the prolonged conflict in the South China Sea?
The prolonged conflict in the South China Sea can be attributed to a variety of factors, including territorial disputes, competing claims, geopolitical rivalry, resource competition, and the presence of strategic assets. Additionally, the region's history of colonialism and Imperialism have shaped the current political and economic dynamics, with dominant powers exerting influence over smaller countries and their resources. The involvement of the United States and China in the region has further complicated the situation, with both countries seeking to assert their influence and protect their interests. The lack of a clear legal framework for resolving disputes and the absence of an effective mechanism for resolving conflicts have also hampered progress towards a peaceful resolution. Ultimately, a comprehensive and multidimensional approach is needed to address the complex issues underlying the South China Sea conflict, including diplomacy, regional cooperation, and international mediation.
Answer:What are some potential challenges that the international community may face in effectively contributing to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and promoting peace in the region?

 There are several potential challenges that the international community may encounter when attempting to contribute to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and promoting peace in the region. Firstly, deep-rooted historical grievances and narratives on both sides make it difficult to bridge the gap between Israel and Palestine. The lack of trust and willingness to compromise can hinder progress in negotiations. Secondly, geopolitical interests and alliances among major powers can complicate efforts for a neutral and unbiased approach towards mediation. Thirdly, ensuring sustained commitment from all parties involved over an extended period of time can be challenging, as political dynamics often shift, priorities change, and domestic pressures come into play. Fourthly, addressing issues such as settlements, borders, refugees, security arrangements, and Jerusalem require delicate negotiations where finding mutually acceptable solutions can be arduous. Lastly, navigating through differing interpretations of international law related to self-determination, occupation, and sovereignty adds another layer of complexity. Overcoming these challenges will require persistent diplomatic engagement, consensus-building efforts among diverse stakeholders, genuine commitment from all parties involved, and a focus on long-term sustainable solutions rather than short-term gains.

Question:What are the potential consequences of failing to effectively resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and promote peace in the region?

 Failing to effectively resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and promote peace in the region can have significant consequences. Firstly, ongoing violence and tensions can lead to further loss of life, destruction, and suffering for both Israelis and Palestinians. The cycle of violence perpetuates a sense of fear, hostility, and deepens divisions between communities. Secondly, the lack of resolution hampers regional stability, as it creates a fertile ground for extremist ideologies and radicalization. This instability can spill over into neighboring countries, exacerbating existing conflicts or giving rise to new ones. Thirdly, the prolonged conflict undermines trust in international institutions and diminishes hope for peaceful resolutions elsewhere in the world. It erodes confidence in diplomacy as an effective tool for resolving disputes. Lastly, failure to address this long-standing conflict perpetuates a sense of injustice among Palestinians and can fuel resentment towards Israel and potentially generate further acts of violence or terrorism. Therefore, it is crucial for the international community to prioritize efforts towards resolving this conflict to prevent these potential consequences from materializing.

\section{INTRODUCTION}

Fluorescence microscopy is a modality that allows imaging of subcellular structures from live specimens \cite{bib:Piston1999, bib:Vonesch2006}. During this image acquisition process, large datasets of 3D microscopy image volumes are generated.
The quantitative analysis of the fluorescence microscopy volume is hampered by light diffraction, distortion created by lens aberrations in different directions, complex variation of biological structures \cite{bib:Murphy2012}. The image acquisition process can be typically modeled as the convolution of the observed objects with a 3D point spread function (PSF) followed by degradation from noise such as Poisson noise and Gaussian noise \cite{bib:Yang2015}. 
These limitations result in anisotropic, inhomogeneous background, blurry (out-of-focus), and noisy image volume with poor edge details which aggravate the image quality poorer in depth \cite{bib:SLee2018a}.

There has been various approaches to improve 3D fluorescence microscopy images quality. One popular approach is known as image deconvolution which ``inverts'' the convolution process to restore the original microscopy image volume \cite{bib:Sarder2006}. 
Richard-Lucy (RL) deconvolution \cite{bib:Richard1972, bib:Lucy1974} which maximizes the likelihood distribution based on a Poisson noise assumption for confocal microscopy was proposed. This RL deconvolution was further extended in \cite{bib:Dey2006} that incorporated the total variation as a regularization term in the cost function. Since the PSF is usually not known, blind deconvolution which estimates the PSF and the original image simultaneously is favorable \cite{bib:Shajkofci2018}. Blind deconvolution using RL deconvolution was described in \cite{bib:Fish1995}. A pupil model for the PSF was presented in \cite{bib:Soulez2012} and the PSF was estimated using machine learning approaches in \cite{bib:Kenig2010}. Sparse coding to learn 2D features for coarse resolution along the depth axis to mitigate anisotropic issues was presented in \cite{bib:Soulez2014}.

Another approach to achieve better image quality stems from image denoising research. 
One example is Poisson noise removal using a combination of the Haar wavelet and the linear expansion of thresholds (PURE-LET) proposed in \cite{bib:PureDenoise}. This PURE-LET approach was extended further to 3D widefield microscopy in \cite{bib:JLi2017}. Additionally, a denoising and deblurring method for Poisson noise corrupted data using variance stabilizing transforms (VST) was described in \cite{bib:Azzari2017}. Meanwhile, a 3D inhomogeneity correction method that combines 3D active contours segmentation was presented in \cite{bib:SLee2017}. 

Convolutional neural network (CNN) has been popular to address various problems in medical image analysis and computer vision  such as image denoising, image segmentation, and image registration \cite{bib:Litjens2017}.
There are few papers that focus on image deconvolution in fluorescence microscopy using CNNs. 
One example is an anisotropic fluorescence microscopy restoration method using a CNN \cite{bib:Weigert2017}. Later, semi-blind spatially-variant deconvolution in optical microscopy with a local PSF using a CNN was described in \cite{bib:Shajkofci2018}

Text: "In the case of the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion Project, the province of British Columbia has expressed concerns about the potential risks to the environment, particularly in relation to the province's coastline and waterways. These concerns are not unfounded, as the project would involve the transportation of diluted bitumen, a highly polluting and risky form of oil, through sensitive ecosystems and waters."
Paraphrase: One of the primary concerns associated with the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion Project in British Columbia is the potential environmental risks, particularly in relation to the province's coastline and waterways. These concerns are well-founded, given that the project involves transporting diluted bitumen, a highly polluting and risky form of oil, through sensitive ecosystems and waters.

Answer:Q. How might the approval of the Trans Mountain pipeline by the Federal government potentially impact Alberta-British Columbia relations, given their opposing views on the project?

Question:following the pipeline's construction and operation. These impacts could lead to reduced fish populations, affecting the livelihoods of local communities and Indigenous peoples who rely on fishing for their sustenance and cultural practices.
2. Wildlife: The project's construction and operation may also negatively impact wildlife habitats and migration routes, disrupting the natural balance of the ecosystem. For instance, birds and other animals could face habitat fragmentation and loss, which could affect their populations and migration patterns.
3. Water resources: As the pipeline would transport diluted bitumen, a highly polluting and risky form of oil, there are concerns that a spill could have devastating effects on British Columbia's water resources, including rivers, lakes, and the ocean. This could lead to the contamination of drinking water sources and harm aquatic life. In contrast, the government argues that the project would support

Congress Gives Itself More Free Parking Than Its Own Rules Allow

As TransitCenter and the Frontier Group reported last week, the federal government pays a huge $7.3 billion subsidy to people who drive to work by making commuter parking expenses tax exempt. There are countless reasons for Congress to scrap this poorly-conceived, congestion-inducing subsidy. While policymakers consider the big picture, they also ought to examine how their own parking benefits are administered.

Here’s the short version: Congress is breaking its own law, and it’s shorting the Treasury hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, by providing free parking far in excess of the allowable limits.

USC 26 Section 132f of the tax code allows employers to provide each worker with up to $250 in free parking per month tax-free, which can add up to $3,000 in tax-free perks per employee each year. That’s a pretty big amount to pay people for exacerbating congestion, but the parking at the U.S. Capitol is worth significantly more than that.

It’s hard to know exactly how many free parking spaces we’re talking about. The Architect of the Capitol and relevant committees don’t like to talk about it, but Lydia DePillis reported in the Washington City Paper a few years ago that a plan for the southern part of the Capitol complex completed in 2005 shows that the House office buildings alone have 5,772 parking spaces assigned to them.

To figure out the market value of those spots, it would help to be able to check the rates at adjacent private lots. The problem is: There are no adjacent private lots.

According to SpotHero, there are no available monthly parking spots within a mile of the Capitol. The closest one — about a 20 minute walk to either the House side or the Senate side — costs $270.

There are some cheaper options a little farther away, but the cost of parking more than a mile from the destination is almost inconsequential. Given the extreme scarcity of parking near the Capitol, which employs and attracts tens of thousands of people daily, you can bet that on-site parking is worth significantly more than faraway options. Moreover, if so many employees didn’t get free parking on the Capitol grounds, how would that affect demand, and therefore parking rates, at surrounding lots?

According to the law, if an employee is provided with free parking in excess of the allowable limit, the difference should be reported as taxable income, and the employer would have to pay all the normal employment taxes (Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid, etc.) on that portion.

IRS staff affirm that the value of any fringe benefit is based on the market. Congress can’t just say the parking is worth $250 and call it a day. They have to acknowledge that the benefit they are providing to staff and members is worth the market price. In the case of a reserved parking space directly on the Capitol grounds, it is likely worth much more than the $270 per month established by the adjacent market for parking.

With this understanding, every staffer and member of Congress receiving free parking is not paying tax on at least $240 in annual compensation — and that is a minimum estimate. Having seen staffers’ pay stubs, I can verify that they are not paying the full value of the parking provided. The failure to report and tax this additional income easily costs the Treasury hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.

The scandalous part is that this is a rule that Congress directly controls

As the world moves increasingly towards globalization and emerging markets, it remains to be seen whether the US will be able to adapt and maintain its dominant role or if a new order will emerge.
Answer:Q: How has criticism from other countries questioned the United States' global leadership status?
Paraphrased part: Recent events and criticisms from other nations, including Russia and China, have challenged the United States' status as a global superpower by questioning its military approach to conflicts and advocating for a more diplomatic and peaceful approach to international relations.
Question:Sure, I will do my best to provide a helpful and insightful question based on the context you have provided. Here is my Q:
What specific examples can you provide of how a more diplomatic and peaceful approach to international relations could be applied in practice, and how could it benefit the global community as a whole?
Answer:Q. How might the criticisms of Russia and China regarding the United States' global leadership impact the balance of power in international relations?

 The criticisms from Russia and China regarding the United States' global leadership, particularly in terms of its military approach to conflicts, can potentially shift the balance of power in international relations. If more countries align themselves with Russia and China's calls for a more diplomatic and peaceful approach, it could lead to a redistribution of influence and challenge the US's dominant position. This shift towards a polycentric or multipolar world order may bring about changes in how global affairs are conducted, potentially impacting alliances, trade agreements, and geopolitical dynamics. It remains to be seen how these criticisms will shape the future landscape of international relations.

Donald Trump's origin story tells the tale of a scrappy kid who made his own way to a golden throne in a Manhattan penthouse with nothing more than a small, million-dollar "loan" from his father. But the reality is that Fred Trump had to help out his son much more significantly, because, as we all now know, his son is a big-time business loser.

Donald Trump is not the wildly successful businessman he has portrayed himself to be.

And following his devastatingly bad business decisions in the 1980s — many of which are detailed in this 1990 Fortune profile — Trump was obliged to turn to his father for multiple bailouts. The New York Times reports:

Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee for president, portrays himself now as a self-made man who began life with what he has characterized as a meager $1 million advance from his father. That figure itself represents a significant understatement about the support his father provided him over the years. But in his darkest moment, Mr. Trump again leaned on his family’s wealth, this time to ride out a financial tsunami.

The “financial tsunami” was caused by Trump’s bad decision-making, over-borrowing, miscalculating the future of high-interest junk bonds, overextending himself with extravagant purchases, mismanaging his businesses which were losing money, and a financial recession.

By 1991, he barely had enough cash to keep up with his personal monthly expenses. So he turned to his dad.

He promised to make up for a cash shortfall with the sale of condominium units in Trump Tower in Manhattan. When that did not generate enough money, he filled the hole in his balance sheet with the “unforecasted receipt of funds from certain family-owned properties in New York City” — apparently referring to fees from properties his father, Fred C. Trump, had built outside Manhattan. At the end of 1990, when Mr. Trump was facing an $18.4 million interest payment, his father sent a lawyer to the Castle casino to buy $3.3 million in chips and leave without cashing them, providing his son with an infusion of cash.

As BuzzFeed’s Andrew Kaczynski reported in 2015, that “loan” prompted an investigation from the Division of Gaming Enforcement, who “ultimately found the loan to be illegal. In the end, Trump got to keep the money but had to pay a $30,000 fine.”

“Sweeney said Fred Trump also agreed to apply for a license as a financial source, which would make another such loan possible in June, when the next interest payment is due,” a Philadelphia Inquirer story from the time read. Fred Trump would make further payments to his son, and Donald Trump ultimately settled his debts

Just when the people of the Middle East thought things couldn’t get any worse, Donald J. Trump is elected president of the United States. Now, their apprehension about the president-elect dwarfs their disappointment with President Obama.

It could be a blessing in disguise.

America, in one magic moment, you’ve revealed how you’ve changed. For the worse. Poor you, you feel so insecure, vulnerable and fragile. Like the rest of us.

So, instead of reaching for your famed “can-do” spirit, lifting yourselves up by the bootstraps, you turned to a strident, bellicose type of nationalism. The kind usually associated with strutting generalissimos of Third World nations with their chests covered with made-up, self-awarded medals.

Maybe the people of the Middle East will look and realize that you are no longer the Great Democracy to emulate. That your modern style of empire and your role as keeper of the world order for the world’s own good are stumbling and failing, even in your own eyes; and that we in the Middle East should not be turning to you for rescue.

For as long as I can remember, you’ve been on a self-assigned mission to change the Middle East. Indeed, the world. Now, it seems as if the change has flowed the other way.

You’ve voted to reduce your liberties. To narrow the range of people entitled to justice and equality before the law. To live in a place where the police should not be criticized; where fighting political correctness is more important than fighting racism; where Muslims are suspected and people who appear Hispanic can be rounded up if they’re not carrying their papers.

In this election you’ve revealed that your people — like Russians, Hungarians, Iraqis, Iranians and others whose politics you normally look down on — will choose a narrow, nonsensical nationalist ethos when they feel threatened by uncertainty. Your imperial outreach allowed you to experience other cultures, but now you’ve chosen to shrink your outlook, with the expectation that the world will continue to revolve around you

Question:Why do you think a shift in perspective towards inwardness may cause someone to miss out on new experiences and perspectives?
Answer:How can a shift towards inwardness potentially limit one's exposure to new experiences and perspectives?

 When someone chooses to focus inward and expects the world to revolve around them, there is a risk of becoming closed off to the diversity of experiences and perspectives that exist outside of their own. By turning inward, they may inadvertently isolate themselves from opportunities for cultural exchange and outreach. This self-centered perspective can lead to a lack of curiosity about the world around them, inhibiting personal growth and understanding.

Engaging in outreach and cultural exchange allows individuals to broaden their horizons, challenge preconceived notions, and gain fresh insights into different cultures, ideas, and ways of life. It encourages empathy, tolerance, and an appreciation for diversity. By actively seeking out new experiences and perspectives through outreach, individuals have the opportunity to expand their knowledge, develop new skills, foster meaningful connections with others, and contribute positively to society.

However, when one shifts their focus solely inward and expects the world to revolve around them, they may unintentionally limit themselves to their own familiar bubble. This insular mindset can hinder personal growth by restricting exposure to different viewpoints or challenging situations that can stimulate intellectual curiosity and broaden one's understanding of the world.

In essence, while it is important to take care of oneself and prioritize personal well-being at times, it is equally crucial not to become so self-absorbed that we miss out on valuable opportunities for growth through engagement with others. Balancing introspection with outward exploration allows for a more comprehensive understanding of ourselves as well as the world we inhabit.

Answer:Once upon a time, in a quiet village nestled in the mountains, there lived a young woman named Lily. She was well-known in the village for her wisdom and kindness, which she had gained through her extensive travels and experiences around the world.
Lily had spent her youth venturing far and wide, meeting people from all walks of life, learning about their cultures, and sharing her own.

Through these experiences, Lily had gained a wealth of knowledge and a deep understanding of the world's diversity.
However, one day, Lily decided to retire to the peaceful village where she had grown up. She felt that she had seen and experienced enough, and wanted to focus on

Image copyright AFP Image caption Belvedere Zoo has long faced problems with litter and visitors' behaviour

A zoo in the Tunisian capital is to close temporarily after visitors stoned a crocodile to death.

The Belvedere Zoo posted pictures of the bloodied reptile, with a paving stone and rock next to its head, on its Facebook page on Wednesday.

It died from an internal haemorrhage, the Tunis municipality said.

More guards and environmental police will be employed at the site after "emergency cleaning and maintenance works", the environment ministry said.

Measures would be introduced to manage visitors entering and exiting, it said.

"It's terrible. You cannot imagine what animals endure from some visitors," Amor Ennaifer, a vet at the zoo, told AFP news agency.

Answer:Q: How does a zoo ensure the safety and well-being of its animals?
A: A zoo ensures the safety and well-being of its animals through a variety of measures, including security measures such as surveillance cameras, alarms, and security personnel, as well as visitor management systems that limit direct contact between visitors and animals to prevent disruptive behavior or littering. For instance, some zoos have designated paths for visitors to follow, or provide bins for trash disposal to minimize litter. These measures are critical to maintaining a safe and healthy environment for both the animals and the visitors.

After a first opening day win in five years, Everton are in confident mood. Everton’s belief highlighted by Nikica Jelavic’s post-match comments on Monday:

“Manchester United are strong but we killed them. David de Gea saved them. We could have really destroyed them”.

Monday’s win was Everton’s first opening day win and clean sheet since August 1996.

Recent Form

Aston Villa succumbed to an opening day loss at newly promoted West Ham. Despite controlling the early stages, Villa faded and West Ham could have stretched their lead. Paul Lambert will look for a quick response from his side when Everton visit.

The two teams are at opposite ends of the form spectrum. David Moyes’ men are in fine form with three defeats in 24 games. Aiming for a club record 11 Premier League games unbeaten, Everton are flying.

Unlike Everton, Aston Villa start Saturday’s match looking for a first league win in 12 matches. Villa’s struggles are clear in their home form with Lambert’s side winning one of 13 league games at Villa Park.

Past Meetings

Everton are clear favourites on current form but Villa hold the edge in past meetings. Unbeaten in 12 league meetings, Villa are Everton’s bogey team. Everton’s last win at Villa Park came in February 2005 with no wins since. The 2005 victory is Everton’s only win at Villa since 1987 (24 meetings).

Despite Everton’s winless streak, eight of the 12 matches ended in draws

Answer:1. Can you explain the concept of atmospheric correction in remote sensing, and how it helps to remove the effects of atmospheric and solar radiation on the observed data?
Atmospheric correction is the process of removing the effects of the Earth's atmosphere and solar radiation on remote sensing data. It is an important step in the remote sensing data processing chain as the atmosphere can have a significant impact on the observed signal, particularly for sensors with a low signal-to-noise ratio. Solar radiation can cause brightness temperature variations, resulting in a distorted reflectance factor. Atmospheric correction aims to correct these effects and produce a more accurate estimate of the surface reflectance.
The most common approach to atmospheric correction is the use of atmospheric models. These models simulate the atmospheric conditions at the time of data collection and estimate the effects of atmospheric and solar radiation on the observed data. These effects can be corrected by applying the model-derived atmospheric correction parameters to the data. The parameters consider the atmospheric conditions, such as atmospheric corrected radiance, aerosol optical depth, and water vapor mixing

The preceding message discusses the challenges and advancements in estimating model parameters under Huber's $\epsilon$-contamination model. It highlights the trade-off between statistical optimality and computational feasibility in robust estimation. The message also compares the advantages of depth-based estimators, such as Tukey's median, with computationally feasible procedures proposed in recent literature. 

 What are the advantages of depth-based estimators compared to computationally feasible procedures for robust estimation?

 Depth-based estimators have clear objective functions, adaptability to nuisance parameters, and can be used for robust location estimation under general settings where moments may not exist. In contrast, many computationally feasible procedures rely on assumptions about covariance structures and contamination proportions, requiring modifications for extensions and potentially affecting error rates.
Previous Question 
Question:[Answer]: In the context of robust estimation, can you explain how depth-based estimators compare to computationally feasible procedures for estimating the median of a distribution under Huber's $\epsilon$-contamination model?
Answer:Certainly! Here's my inquiry:

What are the main benefits of using depth-based estimators like Tukey's median instead of computationally feasible methods for robust estimation under Huber's $\epsilon$-contamination model?

And here's my retort:

The key advantages of depth-based estimators like Tukey's median over computationally feasible methods for robust estimation under Huber's $\epsilon$-contamination model include:

1. Clear objective functions: Depth-based estimators have well-defined optimization problems, which allows for more trans
Question:The text describes the concept of depth-based estimators and their advantages in addressing contamination in spectroscopic data. The key takeaways are:
1. Depth-based estimators have well-defined optimization problems, making them easier to interpret and optimize.
2. These estimators offer a balance between model complexity and interpretability, making them more robust to noise and outliers.
3. They can be applied to a variety of remote sensing applications, such as atmospheric and terrestrial remote sensing, and plant canopy and atmospheric studies.
Answer:1. Can you explain the concept of atmospheric correction in remote sensing, and how it helps to remove the effects of atmospheric and solar radiation on the observed data?
Atmospheric correction is the process of removing the effects of the Earth's atmosphere and solar radiation on remote sensing data. It is an important step in the remote sensing data processing chain as the atmosphere can have a significant impact on the observed signal, particularly for sensors with a low signal-to-noise ratio. Solar radiation can cause brightness temperature variations, resulting in a distorted reflectance factor. Atmospheric correction aims to correct these effects and produce a more accurate estimate of the surface reflectance.
The most common approach to atmospheric correction is the use of atmospheric models. These models simulate the atmospheric conditions at the time of data collection and estimate the effects of atmospheric and solar radiation on the observed data. These effects can be corrected by applying the model-derived atmospheric correction parameters to the data. The parameters consider the atmospheric conditions, such as atmospheric corrected radiance, aerosol optical depth, and water vapor mixing

Answer:The single scattering albedo provides a measure of the quality of the data by offering a more accurate representation of the surface reflectance, which is crucial for various applications like terrestrial remote sensing and atmospheric studies. It is calculated by dividing the scattering coefficient by the incident photon flux density. The higher the value of the single scattering albedo, the more accurate the surface reflectance estimate.

Question:What are some advantages of depth-based estimators in robust estimation compared to computationally feasible procedures?

 Depth-based estimators offer clear objective functions with adaptability to nuisance parameters; while many computationally feasible procedures may assume specific covariance structures or contamination proportions, making their performance vulnerable if modifications for different settings or assumptions become necessary, compromising error rates and possibly affecting results.

\section{Proof of Proposition 2.1}

Let $h_i=a_ie^{j\theta_i}$, $g_i=b_ie^{j\psi_i}$ be the polar form representation of $h_i$ and $g_i$, respectively. Note that $a_i$ and $b_i$ are i.i.d. Rayleigh random variables with scale parameter $\nu=1$. Thus, one could rewrite Eq. \ref{eq:y} as follows:
\begin{align}
y=\sqrt{p_t\zeta}\sum_{i=1}^Na_ib_ie^{j(\phi_i+\theta_i+\psi_i)}x + w
\end{align}
Recall from assumption A3 that the IRS controller has perfect CSI of both hops at its disposal, it employs transmit beamforming mechanism which leads to zero phase error at the UE. In other words, the IRS controller sets the phase of its $i$-th element as follows: $\phi_i=-\theta_i-\psi_i$. Thus, the SNR at the UE becomes:
\begin{align}
\gamma=\frac{p_t\zeta\vert \sum_{i=1}^Na_ib_i\vert^2}{\sigma^2}=\left(\frac{\sqrt{p_t\zeta} \sum_{i=1}^N(a_ib_i)}{\sigma}\right)^2
\end{align}

Let $A_i=\frac{\sqrt{p_t\zeta}}{\sigma}a_ib_i$, then $E(A_i)=\frac{\sqrt{p_t\zeta}\pi}{2\sigma }$ and $V(A_i)=\frac{p_t \zeta(16-\pi^2)}{4\sigma^2}$. For $N$ reasonablly large, one could invoke the Central Limit Theorem to get the following result: $\sum_{i=1}^NA_i\sim \mathcal{N}(N(\frac{\sqrt{p_t \zeta}\pi}{2\sigma }),N(\frac{p_t \zeta(16-\pi^2)}{4\sigma^2}))$. Finally,
\begin{align}
\gamma=N\frac{p_t \zeta(16-\pi^2)}{4\sigma^2}\chi_1^2(\lambda).
\end{align}

\section{Proof of Proposition 2.2}
To derive the distribution of the SNR for the IRS-assisted MISO downlink, we begin by assuming $N=2$ and $N_t=2$. This allows us to write the following equation:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:app21}
\mathbf{g}^H\mathbf{\Pi}\mathbf{Hf}=\pi_1g_1(f_1h_{11}+f_2h_{12})+\pi_2g_2(f_1h_{21}+f_2h_{22})
\end{align}
where $\pi_i=e^{j\phi_i}$. We design the reflection coefficients matrix $\mathbf{\Pi}$ at the IRS as follows: $\mathbf{\Pi} = diag[\mathbf{\frac{g}{||g||^2}}]$. Thus, $\mathbf{g}^H\mathbf{\Pi} = [1, \, 1]$. In plain words, we have designed $\mathbf{\Pi}$ such that the IRS does transmit beamforming on the second hop (which effectively cancels out the effects of the channels on the second hop). Therefore, we could re-write Eq. \ref{eq:app21} as follows:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:app22}
\mathbf{g}^H\mathbf{\Pi}\mathbf{Hf}=(f_1h_{11}+f_2h_{12})+(f_1h_{21}+f_2h_{22})
\end{align}

Let $\mathcal{A}=(f_1h_{11}+f_2h_{12})$, and $\mathcal{B}=(f_1h_{21}+f_2h_{22})$. Then, one could verify that $\mathcal{A} \sim C\mathcal{N}(0,\vert f_1\vert^2+\vert f_2\vert^2)$, and that $\mathcal{B} \sim C\mathcal{N}(0,\vert f_1\vert^2+\vert f_2\vert^2)$. Thus, $\mathbf{g}^H\mathbf{\Pi}\mathbf{Hf}$ is the sum of two i.i.d

The preceding message presents two proofs related to the SNR in an IRS-assisted MISO downlink communication system.

The second proof considers a specific scenario with $N=2$ reflecting elements and $N_t=2$ transmit antennas. It shows that under certain assumptions on the design of reflection coefficients at the IRS, the expression for $\mathbf{g}^H\mathbf{\Pi}\mathbf{Hf}$ simplifies to a sum of two independent complex Gaussian random variables.

\section{Horrocks data bundles on ACM Varieties}
 Let $X$ be a smooth ACM variety of dimension $n$ in $\mathbb P^{n+r}$ over a field $k$.  For any sheaf $\sB$ on $X$, $H^i_*(\sB)$ will denote
 $\oplus_{l\in \mathbb Z}H^i(X, \sB(l))$.  The coordinate ring of $X$, $A=H^0_*(\O{X})$, is a noetherian Cohen-Macaulay graded
 $k$-algebra. $H^i_*(\sB)$ is a graded module
 over $A$. Let \textbf{M} be the
 category of graded, finitely generated $A$-modules and graded homomorphisms. Any finitely generated projective graded
 $A$ module  has the form $\oplus_i A(a_i)$ for some shifts $a_i\in \mathbb Z$ in grading, and will be called a free
 $A$-module.
 Let $\mathfrak P \subset
 \textbf{M}$ be the full subcategory of finitely generated free $A$-modules.
 $\mathcal C^-(\textbf M)$ (respectively $\mathcal C^-(\mathfrak P)$) will denote the category of all complexes, bounded above,
 of objects in $\textbf M$ (resp. $\mathfrak P$), where morphisms are  maps between two complexes.
 Since \textbf{M} has enough projectives, given a complex $C^\centerdot$ of objects in \textbf{M}, bounded above,
 one can find a free resolution:
\textit{ie.} a complex $P^\centerdot$ in $\mathcal C^-(\mathfrak P)$ with a quasi-isomorphism $P^\centerdot \to C^\centerdot$.

Let $\sE \in \textbf{VB}$ be an object in the category of vector bundles of finite rank on $X$. $H^i_*(\sE)$ is an $A$-module
of finite length for $1\leq i\leq n-1$. A vector
bundle will be called free if it has the form $\oplus_i \sO_X(a_i)$.  A vector bundle $\sE$ will be
called ACM (arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay) if $H^i_*(\sE)=0$ for all $1\leq i\leq n-1$. Since $X$ is ACM, every free bundle is
ACM. By Serre duality, the line bundle $\omega_X$ is an ACM line bundle.

Given $\sE$, let $E$ denote the graded $A$-module $H^0_*(\sE) $. Denoting duals by $^\vee$ in the categories \textbf{VB} and
\textbf{M}, we have $H^0_*(\sE^\vee) \cong (H^0_*(\sE))^\vee $.
Following Horrocks, we choose a resolution of $H^0_*(\sE^\vee)$ by finitely generated free modules:
\begin{equation}\label{Ho1} \dots \to C^{3\vee} \to C^{2\vee} \to C^{1\vee} \to C^{0\vee} \to H^0_*(\sE^\vee)
\to 0.\end{equation} In \cite{Ho}, this could be chosen as a finite resolution, but in our case, it may be infinite. However,
if $K = \ker(C^{n-2\vee} \to C^{n-3\vee})$, then $\sK$ is an ACM vector bundle on $X$ where $\sK=\tilde K$ is the sheaf obtained
from $K$.
Replacing the terms up to and including $C^{n-1\vee}$ by $K$ and dualizing, we get the complex,

\begin{equation}\label{Ho2} C^{\centerdot}_{\{0,n\}}:  0 \to C^0 \xrightarrow {\delta^1_{C^\centerdot}} C^1 \xrightarrow
{\delta^2_{C^\centerdot}} C^2 \xrightarrow {\delta^3_{C^\centerdot}} \dots\xrightarrow {\delta^{n-2}_{C^\centerdot}} C^{n-2}\to
K^\vee \to 0.\end{equation}

The exact sequence (\ref{Ho1}), when sheafified, gives an exact sequence of vector bundles, and its  dual gives the exact
sequence of vector bundles
\begin{equation}\label{Ho3} 0 \to \sE \to \tilde C^0 \xrightarrow {\delta^1_{C^\centerdot}} \tilde C^1 \xrightarrow
{\delta^2_{C^\centerdot}} \tilde C^2 \xrightarrow {\delta^3_{C^\centerdot}} \dots\xrightarrow {\delta^{n-2}_{C^\centerdot}}
\tilde C^{n-2}\to \sK^{\vee} \to 0.\end{equation}

From this it becomes evident that $E = H^0_*(\sE)$ is given as $H^0(C^\centerdot_{\{0,n\}})$, and $ H^i_*(\sE)=
H^i(C^\centerdot_{\{0,n\}})$ for $i=1,\dots n-1$ (where $C_{\{0,n\}}^{n-1}$ is understood to refer to $K^\vee$).

$E$ itself has a free resolution (again possible infinite). Splice $ C^\centerdot_{\{0,n\}}$ with a  free resolution
$L^\centerdot$ of $E$ and call the resulting complex $C^\centerdot$

Seattle Police released dashcam video and audio of the fatal shooting of Charleena Lyles in Magnuson Park. Officers can be heard shouting “Get back! Get back!” before gunfire breaks out. Also, details from a June 5 call to her home bear striking similarity to Sunday’s incident.

Two weeks ago, Seattle police responded to a domestic-violence call at the home of 30-year-old Charleena Lyles.

During the encounter, police say Lyles armed herself with a pair of shears and threatened officers. Although the officers reported that they feared for their safety, they were able to talk a distraught Lyles into dropping the shears.

The June 5 call is strikingly similar to Sunday’s incident at Lyles’ Magnuson Park apartment, which ended with the mother of four being shot to death by two officers. Police say Lyles was armed with two knives, according to a newly released transcript of audio of the shooting.

Family members are angry that officers used deadly force when police concede that the two responding officers had “less lethal-force options” at their disposal, although the department has confirmed that neither was carrying a Taser.

Lyles had been struggling with mental-health issues for the past year and was concerned that authorities would take her children, one of whom they said has Down syndrome, her family said.

Both of the officers involved had undergone Crisis Intervention Training (CIT) and one was a certified CIT officer, meaning he had undergone additional intensive de-escalation and mental-health intervention training, Police Chief Kathleen O’Toole said Monday.

Lyles’ family said Sunday that the shooting could have been avoided and that they believe race — she was African American — was a factor. The officers who shot Lyles are white, police said.

“Why couldn’t they have Tased her? They could have taken her down. I could have taken her down,” said Monika Williams, Lyles’ sister.

O’Toole said Monday neither officer was armed with a Taser. SPD officers are given the option of carrying a Taser, pepper spray or a baton as a less-then-lethal option.

“The message I’m trying to get out right now is that this is a horrible tragedy all around,” O’Toole said. “The community is distraught. The family is distraught. The officers are distraught.”

The names of the police officers who shot Lyles have not been released.

O’Toole promised the department’s investigation into the shooting would be transparent and “that we’ll go where the truth takes us

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} paper proposes a novel background calibration
technique for Time-Interleaved Analog-to-Digital Converters
(TI-ADCs)used in equalized digital communication receivers. It
generalizes a previously proposed technique
\cite{tsai_correction_2009,luna_compensation_2006,
  agazzi_90_2008}. Current and emerging digital receivers for ultra
high-speed communication systems~\cite{morero_design_2016,
  faruk_digital_2017, crivelli_architecture_2014, palermo_cmos_2016,
  ethernet_alliance_2020_2020, brandolini_5_2015,xu_5-bit_2016}
require large bandwidth, high sampling rate Analog-to-Digital
Converters (ADCs).

The TI-ADC~\cite{laperle_advances_2014,kull_cmos_2016} has been the
technique predominantly used to meet the demanding sampling rate and
bandwidth requirements of high-speed transceivers.

The performance of TI-ADCs is affected by mismatches among the
interleaves~\cite{kurosawa_explicit_2001,vogel_impact_2005}. Mismatches
of sampling time, gain, bandwidth, as well as DC offset, are the most
common impairments. Many calibration techniques have been proposed in
the literature. Please see \cite{wei_8_2014, song_10-b_2017,
  mafi_digital_2017, guo_16-gss_2020, lee_1_2014,
  saleem_adaptive_2010, matsuno_all-digital_2013,

  salib_high-precision_2019,
  murmann_digitally_2013,harpe_digitally_2015} and references therein
for a thorough review and discussion.

Calibration techniques for general purpose TI-ADCs in general require
dedicated calibration blocks and algorithms. On the other hand,
several authors \cite{ luna_compensation_2006, tsai_correction_2009,
  agazzi_90_2008} have shown that in the special case of an equalized
digital receiver, it is possible to treat the TI-ADC errors as
integral part of the communication channel and take advantage of the
already existing adaptive equalizer to compensate them. Therefore
calibration becomes an integral part of the channel equalization. No
special purpose analog or digital calibration blocks or algorithms are
required.  Equalizer-based compensation can compensate static as well
as frequency-dependent errors such as bandwidth limitations and
bandwidth or frequency response mismatches among the interleaves of
the ADC. Because the equalizer is adaptive, it also compensates
time-dependent effects such as those caused by temperature and voltage
variations, or by aging. Therefore, equalization becomes the TI-ADC
compensation technique of choice in digital communication receivers

\section{Introduction}

Termination of higher-order term rewriting
systems~\cite[Chapter~11]{Terese2003} has been an active area of
research for several decades.
One powerful method, introduced by v.d. Pol \cite{Pol1993,pol:96},
interprets terms into \emph{weakly monotonic algebras}.  In later work
\cite{FuhsKop2012,Kop2012}, these algebra interpretations are specialised
into \emph{higher-order polynomial interpretations}, a generalisation of
the popular -- and highly automatable -- technique of polynomial
interpretations for first-order term rewriting.

The methods of weakly monotonic algebras and polynomial
interpretation are both limited to \emph{monomorphic} systems.
In this paper, we will further generalise polynomial
interpretations to a higher-order formalism with full impredicative
polymorphism.
This goes beyond shallow (rank-1, weak) polymorphism,
where type quantifiers are effectively allowed only at the top of a
type: it would be relatively easy to extend the methods to a system
with shallow polymorphism since shallowly polymorphic rules can be seen as defining an
infinite set of monomorphic rules.
While shallow polymorphism often suffices
in functional programming practice, there do exist interesting
examples of rewrite systems which require higher-rank impredicative
polymorphism.

For instance, in recent extensions of Haskell one may define a type of
heterogeneous lists.
\[
\begin{array}{ll}
  \mathtt{List} : * &
  \mathtt{foldl}_\sigma(f,a,\mathtt{nil}) \longrightarrow a \\
  \mathtt{nil} : \mathtt{List} &
  \mathtt{foldl}_\sigma(f,a,\mathtt{cons}_\tau(x,l)) \longrightarrow \mathtt{foldl}_\sigma(f,f \tau a x,l) \\
  \mathtt{cons} : \forall \alpha . \alpha \rightarrow \mathtt{List} \rightarrow \mathtt{List} \quad\quad \\
  \multicolumn{2}{l}{\mathtt{foldl} : \forall \beta . (\forall \alpha . \beta \rightarrow \alpha \rightarrow \beta) \rightarrow \beta \rightarrow \mathtt{List} \rightarrow \beta}
\end{array}
\]
The above states that $\mathtt{List}$ is a type ($*$), gives the types of its
two constructors $\mathtt{nil}$ and $\mathtt{cons}$, and defines the corresponding
fold-left function~$\mathtt{foldl}$. Each element of a heterogeneous
list may have a different type. In practice, one would
  constrain the type variable~$\alpha$
  with a type class to
  guarantee the existence of some operations on list elements.  The
function argument of~$\mathtt{foldl}$ receives the element together
with its type. The $\forall$-quantifier binds type variables: a term
of type $\forall \alpha . \tau$ takes a type~$\rho$ as an argument and
the result is a term of type~$\tau[\subst{\alpha}{\rho}]$.

Impredicativity of polymorphism means that the type itself may be
substituted for its own type variable, e

Answer:Of course, I'd be happy to help!
First, let's start by defining what higher-order term rewriting systems are. A higher-order term rewriting system is a system that takes a term (a mathematical expression) and applies a series of rewriting rules to it, with the goal of transforming the term into another term that is equivalent or more desirable in some way. This can be useful for things like program verification, automated proof, and more.
Now, when it comes to the limitations of higher-order term rewriting systems, there are a few key challenges that researchers have identified over the years. One of the main limitations is that many higher-order term rewriting systems can be computationally expensive, meaning that they can take a long time to run and process large terms. Additionally, some higher-order term rewriting systems can be difficult to reason about, making it hard for researchers to understand why the

SPARTA -- The Hopatcong police officer who slapped a bunny-suited, airhorn-toting prankster last fall cut a deal Monday in which he pleaded guilty to harassment and was allowed to keep his job.

Officer Nicholas Maresca Jr. was fined $500 during a 10-minute appearance during Municipal Court Judge John E. Mulhern.

The same fine was meted out April 20 to Kevin Hemmerich, 29, who admitted to disorderly conduct for his role in a bizarre confrontation at police headquarters Nov. 17 that was caught on video.

Before accepting the plea, Mulhern briefly addressed Maresca.

"Did you at that time and in that place subject another to 'offensive touching,'" Mulhern said, referring to the phrasing in the harassment statute.

"Yes, your honor," Maresca replied.

As part of the agreement, Sussex County First Assistant Prosecutor Gregory Mueller dropped a simple assault charge and requested a waiver -- granted by the judge -- from the state law mandating job forfeiture for a public employee convicted of a work-related, petty disorderly persons offense.

Maresca, 45, has been a police officer for 20 years and receives a $103,609 salary, according to public records.

Afterward, Mueller said he was satisfied with the outcome.

"It is no small thing for a police officer to admit to a criminal offense in such a public way, which is what he did," Mueller told NJ Advance Media.

Maresca mingled with about two dozen police supporters after exiting the courtroom but declined comment to reporters.

His attorney, Anthony Iacullo, said, "This resolution provides prompt closure and finality which is something Officer Maresca feels is necessary for those who matter most to him."

Question:Why do you think Hemmerich was separated from the police officers supporting Maresca during his trial? Was this a precautionary measure to ensure a fair trial for both parties? What could be the potential consequences of any bias created by the police officers' presence in the courtroom?
Answer:1. Hemmerich was likely separated from the police officers supporting Maresca to ensure a fair trial for both parties. This separation is often implemented in courts to prevent any outside influence on the case. It helps to maintain a neutral environment where all evidence can be presented objectively and without undue pressure or persuasion. 

2. The presence of police officers supporting Maresca could potentially lead to bias in the courtroom. Even if this bias isn’t overt, it could affect the jurors or other participants in subtle ways. For example, jurors might unconsciously give more weight to testimony from the police officers, seeing them as more reliable sources due to their profession and relationship with Maresca. This could sway the verdict against Hemmerich. On the other hand, it might intimidate Hemmerich and his defense team, potentially affecting their ability to defend themselves effectively.

3. In terms of consequences, these biases could lead to an unfair trial where the true facts of the case are not fully considered and justice may not be served. If the jury or judges are influenced by these biases, it could result in either a wrongful conviction of Hemmerich (if he is found guilty) or a failure to convict Maresca (if he is also involved in any crimes). Overall, such biases could compromise the integrity of the legal process and damage public trust in the justice system.

\section{Introduction}
Determining effective equations of motion of a complex interacting system is a classic problem in Statistical Mechanics \cite{stratonovich_topics_1963, miguel1980colored, haenggi_colored_1995, gardiner_stochastic_2009, pavliotis_stochastic_2014}.
A typical scenario of this kind is encountered when a colloidal particle is immersed in a rapidly fluctuating medium. 
When there exists a clear separation between time scales, the fast degrees of freedom (medium) can be integrated out and subsumed into a reduced set of equations of motion for the slow degrees of freedom (particle).
Several schemes have been proposed in the past to achieve this goal, generally starting form a set of (stochastic) differential equations which are phenomenologically assumed to describe the coupled system composed by the particle and its bath.
Most of these schemes are based on the operator projector formalism \cite{mori_contraction_1980, morita_contraction_1980, zwanzig_non-equilibrium_2001, teVrugt_2020} or on the eigenfunction expansion of the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the original set of Langevin equations \cite{kaneko_adiabatic_1981, theiss_systematic_1985, theiss_remarks_1985, risken_fokker-planck_1989}.

The case in which the tracer particle moves in a correlated medium, which displays long-range correlations and large relaxation times, has recently received renewed attention \cite{demery_drag_2010, dean_diffusion_2011, demery_thermal_2011, demery_perturbative_2011, demery_diffusion_2013, fujitani_fluctuation_2016, Fujitani_2017, gross_dynamics_2021, Venturelli_2022, Basu_2022, Venturelli_2022_2parts}.
Indeed, this paradigm is relevant to describe, \textit{e.g.}, the dynamics of inclusions in lipid membranes \cite{reister_lateral_2005, reister-gottfried_diffusing_2010, camley_contributions_2012, camley_fluctuating_2014, Stumpf_2021}, microemulsions \cite{Gompper_1994,Hennes_1996,Gonnella_1997,Gonnella_1998}, as well as defects in ferromagnetic systems \cite{demery_drag_2010, demery_perturbative_2011}.
Moreover, recent advances in experimental technology have made it possible to measure the critical Casimir forces acting on colloidal particles immersed in near-critical fluid media \cite{hertlein_direct_2008,gambassi_critical_2009,magazzu_controlling_2019}. The properties of these forces, which are the classical thermal counterpart of the celebrated Casimir force in electromagnetism \cite{casimir_attraction_1948}, are relatively well understood in equilibrium \cite{krech_casimir_1994,kardar_friction_1999,brankov_theory_2000,gambassi_casimir_2009,maciolek_collective_2018,Dantchev_2022}, while much remains to be unveiled about their \textit{non-equilibrium} properties. Simple toy models have thus been devised in order to investigate the coupled out of equilibrium dynamics of one or a few particles in contact with near-critical media \cite{demery_drag_2010, demery_perturbative_2011, dean_diffusion_2011, zakine_spatial_2020, gross_dynamics_2021, Venturelli_2022, Basu_2022}. 
Theoretical descriptions of this type of systems often feature a scalar order parameter (OP) $\phi(\bv{r})$, which may represent the relative concentration of the two species in a binary liquid mixture, or else the deviation of the local fluid density from its critical value in a single-component fluid (\textit{i.e.}, $\phi(\bv{r})\propto n-n_c$). A velocity field $\bv{v} (\bv{r},t)$ should be included to allow for the hydrodynamic transport of the OP field and the particle, but we will neglect it here for simplicity \cite{hohenberg_theory_1977}. A possible enhancement or suppression of the OP field or its correlations at the tracer location $\bv{R}(t)$ (representing, e.g., critical adsorption \cite{diehl_field-theoretical_1986}) can be modeled by including in the free energy terms proportional to $\phi(\bv{R})$ or $\phi^2(\bv{R})$, respectively, or derivatives thereof \cite{demery_thermal_2011}.

In order to obtain the effective dynamics of the tracer, a systematic method for the elimination of the field degrees of freedom coupled to $\bv{R} (t)$ from the dynamics is required -- particularly in the case in which the field relaxation is \textit{fast} (compared to the scale of the particle diffusion), but not instantaneous. The problem of the elimination of $N$ (non-interacting) fast variables from a system of $N+M$ stochastic differential equations is of course not new. 
The eigenfunction expansion method \cite{kaneko_adiabatic_1981,theiss_systematic_1985,theiss_remarks_1985} has been successfully applied to the case in which the field-particle coupling is linear, both in a confined geometry \cite{naji_hybrid_2009,gross_dynamics_2021} and in the continuum \cite{Venturelli_2022}. In this setting, the fast variables correspond to the Fourier modes of the field, while the $d$-dimensional coordinates of the particle are the slow variables.
The case of a quadratic coupling has hitherto not been addressed within the above formalism: notably, its underlying working hypothesis that the $N$ fast variables are non-interacting is generally violated, because the coupling to the particle can introduce interactions between the Fourier modes of the field. Other methods \cite{gardiner_adiabatic_1984, gardiner_stochastic_2009} require the specification of a steady-state distribution around which to construct a perturbative series in small powers of an appropriate adiabaticity parameter $\chi$; however, such steady-state distribution is not necessarily known \textit{a priori} when the system is out of equilibrium.

In this paper we present an adiabatic elimination method for a tracer particle with generic (linear or quadratic) couplings to a stochastic background field in confinement. The method consists in a systematic expansion in powers of a small \textit{adiabaticity} parameter $\chi$, which encodes the ratio of the field relaxation timescale to that of the particle diffusion. The procedure is transparent as it is based on a multiple-time-scale (or Chapman-Enskog-like) approach, where we project the dynamics over the \textit{moments} of the joint probability distribution $P(\bv{R},\phi,t)$: this way we obtain a hierarchy of equations for the various moments, which can be truncated by noting that the higher moments relax faster than the lower ones \cite{Cates_2013,Solon_2015, Vishen_2018}.
Notably, no assumption is made \textit{a priori} about the equilibrium distribution of the tracer particle: the steady-state distribution is instead obtained from the method itself, the outcome of which is an effective Fokker-Planck (FP) equation for the tracer position $\bv{R} (t)$. In fact, our method can be applied to systems violating detailed balance between tracer and field degrees of freedom

Previous Question 
Question:Can you provide more details on the proposed method and its underlying assumptions? Especially, how does it handle situations where the tracer and field violate detailed balance?
Answer:Of course! The proposed method is based on the concept of detailed balance, which states that the tracer and field should have the same statistical properties when the system is in equilibrium. To ensure this, the method involves fitting a probability distribution to the data and using it to compute the tracer-field correlations.
Regarding situations where the tracer and field violate detailed balance, the method can handle them by using a generalized version of the detailed balance equation. This equation takes into account the non-equilibrium effects and allows for the estimation of the tracer-field correlations even when the system is not in detailed balance.
Additionally, the method includes a regularization term to stabilize the estimation and prevent overfitting. This term is based on a prior distribution for the tracer and field, which is typically chosen to be a Gaussian distribution with a small variance.

The article proposes a novel method to study the dynamics of a tracer particle interacting with a stochastic background field. The method is based on a multiple-time-scale approach that projects the dynamics onto the moments of the joint distribution of the tracer and field. The method requires no assumption about the equilibrium distribution of the tracer and provides an effective Fokker-Planck equation for the tracer position. The method can be applied to systems violating detailed balance between tracer and field degrees of freedom.
Previous Question 
Question:Can you provide more details on the proposed method and its underlying assumptions? Especially, how does it handle situations where the tracer and field violate detailed balance?
Answer:Of course! The proposed method is based on the concept of detailed balance, which states that the tracer and field should have the same statistical properties when the system is in equilibrium. To ensure this, the method involves fitting a probability distribution to the data and using it to compute the tracer-field correlations.
Regarding situations where the tracer and field violate detailed balance, the method can handle them by using a generalized version of the detailed balance equation. This equation takes into account the non-equilibrium effects and allows for the estimation of the tracer-field correlations even when the system is not in detailed balance.
Additionally, the method includes a regularization term to stabilize the estimation and prevent overfitting. This term is based on a prior distribution for the tracer and field, which is typically chosen to be a Gaussian distribution with a small variance.
Overall, the proposed method provides a robust and flexible approach to estimating trac

Question:What assumptions does the multiple-time-scale approach based on moments for studying tracer particle interactions with stochastic background fields make? 

 One assumption of the multiple-time-scale approach for studying the dynamics of a tracer particle interacting with a stochastic background field using moment projections is the existence of equilibrium conditions between both the tracer's state space variables and those of the field, regardless of any deviations from detailed balance. Moreover, no assumptions regarding the explicit shape or functional form need to be made when estimating correlations within each scale via a generalized version of the detailed balance equation.

hi! is homosexual a slur? i've seen a your posts about people labeling themselves as bi/romantic (I put a slash to keep it out of the tags) and homosexual but i'm having trouble wrapping my head around it. :? I just don't understand haha u___u i'm sorry. you don't have to answer this if you don't want to, it's totally ok! ◥ Anonymous

cishits: Yes it is. It has been used by homophobes to inspire hatred and violence against gay people, it has been said with disdain and mockery, it has been used to categorically pathologize and other a historically marginalized group of people. There is no way it’s not a slur. What is wrong with someone labeling themselves as biromantic and homosexual? Or aromantic and homosexual? I see people labeling themselves this way all the time.

If you say you’re ~biromantic homosexual~ you’re not actually gay, and you’re claiming that what makes you “homosexual” is that you’re sexually attracted to the same gender.

Claiming that gayness can be described as sexual attraction to the same gender contributes to the hypersexualization of gay people, lesbians especially.

Homosexual can only ever mean “exclusive attraction to the same gender”. You cannot separate it from romantic attraction or any other kind of attraction. The same goes for the frequency or intensity of the attraction.

People who aren’t gay, aka, people who experience any kind of man/woman attraction, at all, cannot call themselves homosexual. You cannot be biromantic and homosexual. This goes quintuple for people who claim to be ~biromantic lesbians~

Lesbian means women who are exclusively attracted to other women, and this includes nb women, but no one else. Lesbians have set the boundaries, and those boundaries must be respected.

And it’s better to just call yourself aromantic and gay. Of course if you’re aro and gay you can call yourself homosexual, but there’s no reason to use a term with a history of psychiatric abuse and dehumanization.

Just because you see people labeling themselves this way doesn’t mean they aren’t doing so at the expense of gay people and lesbians particularly

\section{Introduction} 

Let $G$ be any finite simple graph with vertex set $V(G) = \{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$
and edge set $E(G)$, where simple means no loops or
multiple edges.
The \textbf{edge ideal} of $G$ is the ideal
$I(G)=
\left\langle  x_{i}x_{j} \mid \{x_{i},x_{j} \}\in E(G) \right\rangle$
in the polynomial ring $R = k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ ($k$ is any field).
Describing the
dictionary between the graph theoretic properties of $G$
and the algebraic properties of $I(G)$ or $R/I(G)$ is an 
active area of research, e.g., see
\cite{MV,V}.

Relating the homological
invariants of $I(G)$ and the graph theoretic invariants of $G$
has proven to be a fruitful approach to building this
dictionary.  Recall that the  
\textbf{minimal graded free resolution} of $I(G) \subseteq R$
is a long exact sequence of the form
\[
0 \rightarrow \bigoplus_{j} R(-j)^{\beta_{l,j}(I(G))} 
\rightarrow   \bigoplus_{j} R(-j)^{\beta_{l-1,j}(I(G))} \rightarrow \cdots 
\rightarrow   \bigoplus_{j} R(-j)^{\beta_{0,j}(I(G))} \rightarrow 
I(G) \rightarrow 0
\]
where $l \leq n$ and $R(-j)$ is the free $R$-module obtained by shifting 
the degrees of $R$ by $j$ (i.e., $R(-j)_a = R_{a-j}$). 
The number $\beta_{i,j}(I(G))$, the $i,j$-th 
\textbf{graded Betti number} of $I(G)$, equals the number of
minimal generators of degree $j$ in the $i$-th syzygy module of 
$I(G)$.  Two invariants that measure the ``size''
of the resolution are the \textbf{(Castelnuovo-Mumford) regularity}
and the \textbf{projective
dimension}, defined as
\begin{eqnarray*}
{\rm reg}(I(G)) & = & \max\{ j-i \mid \beta_{i,j}(I(G))\neq 0 \}, ~~\mbox{and}~~\\
{\rm pd}(I(G))  & = & \max\{ i \mid \beta_{i,j}(I(G))\neq 0 ~~\mbox{for some $j$}\}.
\end{eqnarray*}
One wishes to relate the numbers $\beta_{i,j}(I(G))$ to the
invariants of $G$; e.g., see the survey of H\`a \cite{Ha} which focuses
on describing ${\rm reg}(I(G))$ in terms of the invariants of $G$.

In this note we give explicit formulas for ${\rm reg}(I(G))$ for the
edge ideals of two infinite families of circulant graphs.
Our results complement previous work on the algebraic and
combinatorial topological properties of circulant
graphs (e.g, \cite{EVMVT,M,Ri,RiRo,RR,R,VMVTW}).
Fix an integer $n \geq 1$ and a subset $S \subseteq \{1,\ldots,\lfloor
\frac{n}{2} \rfloor \}$.  The \textbf{circulant graph}
$C_n(S)$ is the graph on the vertex set $\{x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}\}$
such that $\{x_i,x_j\} \in E(C_n(S))$ if and only if 
$|i-j|$ or $n-|i-j| \in S$. To simplify notation, we write $C_n(a_1,\ldots,a_t)$ instead of
$C_n(\{a_1,\ldots,a_t\})$. As an example, the graph $C_{10}(1,3)$ is drawn
in Figure \ref{circulantex}.
\begin{figure}[h!]
\Circulant{10}{1,3} 
\caption{The circulant $C_{10}(1,3)$}\label{circulantex}
\end{figure}

When $S = \{1,\ldots,\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\}$, then
$C_n(S) \cong K_n$, the clique on $n$ vertices.
On the other hand, if $S = \{1\}$,
then $C_n(1) \cong C_n$, the cycle on $n$ vertices

Question:What is the significance of these two invariants in the context of syzygy modules and how can they be used to provide insights into the module's properties and behavior?
Answer:The two invariants describe the relationship between the degrees of the elements in the basis of a free module and the syzygy modules of the module. They provide information about the structure and behavior of the module and can be used to make predictions about its properties. For example, if the leading coefficient of a syzygy module is zero, it may indicate that the module is not free, or that it has a lower rank than expected. Understanding these invariants can help researchers to better understand the properties and behavior of modules in various fields of mathematics and computer science.

Answer:Sure, here's my A:
In order to maintain the consistency and integrity of data in a database, database designers use a variety of constraints such as primary keys and foreign keys. These constraints ensure that the data is accurate and can be easily accessed when needed.
In addition to these constraints, another important concept used in database design is module invariants. These are essentially statements that are true for all the data in a particular module or section of the database.
By using module invariants, researchers and database designers can better understand the properties and behavior of modules in various fields of mathematics and computer science. They can also use these invariants to ensure that the data in the database remains consistent and accurate.

On the other hand, the projective dimension is defined as the maximum value of $i$ for which there exists a $j$ such that $\beta_{i,j}(I(G))$ is not zero.
Previous Question 
Question:What is the significance of these two invariants in the context of syzygy modules and how can they be used to provide insights into the module's properties and behavior?
Answer:The two invariants describe the relationship between the degrees of the elements in the basis of a free module and the syzygy modules of the module. They provide information about the structure and behavior of the module and can be used to make predictions about its properties. For example, if the leading coefficient of a syzygy module is zero, it may indicate that the module is not free, or that it has a lower rank than expected. Understanding these invariants can help researchers to better understand the properties and behavior of modules in various fields of mathematics and computer science.

An asteroid estimated to be 100 feet in diameter will rocket past Earth on Wednesday at a distance closer than the moon.

But NASA says the space rock poses no danger. The asteroid will still be about 217,000 miles away from Earth when it swings by at around 4 p.m. ET — that's about 22,000 miles closer than the Earth's average distance from the moon.

This space stone is just one of about 20 rocks per year that fly by Earth at a similar distance, according to NASA.

"The Near-Earth Object Observations Program, commonly called "Spaceguard," discovers these objects, characterizes a subset of them and identifies their close approaches to determine if any could be potentially hazardous to our planet," according to NASA's website.

But they don't catch everything. In fact, according to Phil Plait at Slate, NASA found yet another asteroid on Tuesday night that will also soon speed past Earth.

This one is about 10 meters across, half the size of the asteroid that smashed into Chelyabinsk, Russia last year and injured more than 1,400 people, and it'll pass by at a distance of just 35,000 miles around midnight on Thursday. The smaller rock will miss our planet this time, but currently has a 1 in 2.7 million chance of hitting Earth 11 years down the road.

Anyone who wants to watch the bigger asteroid won't be able to do so without a telescope, but but you can track its path in the video, below

### Human: Explain where Jupiter's Great Red Spot is located in more detail.
### Assistant:Jupiter's Great Red Spot is a massive storm that has been raging on the planet for at least 350 years and may have been present for as long as 350 years. Its location is near the planet's equator within a region known as the Southern Hemisphere. The storm itself is roughly the size of Earth and has wind speeds that can reach up to 430 miles per hour.
According to NASA, the storm is a high-pressure system, and its color is due to the presence of chemical compounds such as ammonia and sulfur. These compounds are believed to be mixed with water vapor and rose-colored clouds to create the iconic orange-red hue.
While satellite images and telescopes have allowed scientists to observe the Great Red Spot from afar, NASA's Juno spacecraft has provided unprecedented insight into its workings. The spacecraft has made several close flybys of Jupiter, and its instruments

One year into his term, the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan pledged his vision for a 24hr city, launching a set of ten principles that pave the way for the capital to develop its night time economy, competing with the likes of Berlin, Tokyo and New York.

The principles, focused primarily on promoting cultural, leisure, retail and nightlife activities for all Londoners, rely on an accessible and safe transport network.

Today, London’s £26bn night time economy generates one in eight jobs in the city and the opportunity is set to grow by a further £2bn each year by 2030. The Night Tube, in particular, is projected to bring in £77m per year by 2029.

“We are moving forward as a truly 24hr global capital,” said Amy Lamé, London’s first ever Night Czar, in her keynote speech at UCL Transport Institute’s Night Moves event, a symposium focused on better understanding the challenges of night time transportation. “We can do this safely, we can do it sustainably and I would make the argument that transport is absolutely key to this.”

When the Night Tube was launched in August 2016, it was expected to be an instant hit with night revellers, but with 8.9 million journeys registered in the first 14 months, its popularity has far exceeded expectations.

Crime levels have stayed low despite initial fears of anti-social behaviour, and the Night Tube has now been embraced as a success.

However, gaps in policy and data mean that certain vulnerable categories of passengers, such as women and young men, can still feel unsafe when travelling at night.

Busting the myths

Weeks ahead of the Night Tube’s launch date, fears of an increase in crime and anti-social behaviour flooded the headlines.

A report by the London Assembly’s Police and Crime Committee published at the time warned that sexual offences and other crimes were likely to increase with the introduction of the Night Tube, while Transport for London (TfL) predicted “high crime levels” and a “rowdy environment”. A list of ‘red stations’ believed to be at particular risk of such incidents was published, which included Camden Town, London Bridge, North Greenwich, Vauxhall, Brixton, Waterloo and Oxford Circus.

A year has now passed and the numbers paint a very different picture.

“On average, there are 11 crimes recorded on Night Tube services each weekend,” a TfL spokesperson says. “That’s against the backdrop of around 160,000 journeys, so the crime levels of the Night Tube are low and they account for about 5% of total crime recorded by the British Transport Police (BTP) for London Underground services.

“Crime levels have stayed low despite initial fears of anti-social behaviour.”

“TfL takes customer safety really seriously and we work alongside the police to make sure that both day and night tube services run smoothly and that customers feel like it’s a safe environment.”

The stations open through the night are staffed at all times, while 100 additional dedicated Night Tube BTP officers patrol the grounds, providing a high-visibility police presence.

Campaigns such as Report It to Stop It, which encouraged passengers to call a dedicated number if they suffer from or witness a case of sexual assault, and National Hate Crime Awareness Week have also been positive forces in fighting and reducing crime. According to TfL, the numbers of reports and arrests have increased since the Report It to Stop It campaign was launched.

“This tells us a story about myth-busting,” Lamé said, arguing that the public narrative around the night time economy needs to change.

“[NTE] is not just about night time entertainment. It’s also about people working in essential services,” she said.

More data needed to increase safety

But, as safe as London is now, it can be even safer, especially for women. Between 2011 and 2016, there was a 15% increase in women working night shifts in industries such as care working and nursing, meaning that women now account for more than two-thirds (69%) of the growth in night-working over the past five years

Question:Why are women predominantly occupying night-working roles in industries like care working and nursing?

 Women are increasingly dominating the growth in night-working roles in industries such as care working and nursing due to several factors. Firstly, caregiving roles have traditionally been associated with women, as they are often seen as more nurturing and empathetic. This societal expectation has led to a higher representation of women in these fields overall.

Additionally, the rise in night-working positions can be attributed to the increasing demand for 24/7 healthcare services. As the population ages and healthcare needs expand, there is a greater need for round-the-clock care, leading to an increase in night-shift positions. Women, who already make up a significant portion of the healthcare workforce, are naturally drawn to these opportunities.

Furthermore, practical considerations also play a role. Night shifts often provide more flexibility for women who may have other responsibilities during the day, such as childcare or household duties. The ability to work at night allows them to balance their personal obligations while still pursuing their careers.

Overall, a combination of societal expectations, increasing demand for 24/7 care services, and the flexibility offered by night shifts has contributed to women making up a significant portion of the growth in night-working roles in industries like care working and nursing.

Question:What specific aspects of the workplace culture and policies do you think could be improved to better support women in their careers, particularly those with family responsibilities?
Answer:How can organizations in the healthcare industry promote gender equality and support women with family responsibilities in their careers?

 Organizations in the healthcare industry can promote gender equality and support women with family responsibilities by implementing various measures. Firstly, they can create policies that provide flexible work arrangements, such as part-time options, job-sharing, or remote work opportunities. This flexibility allows women to balance their career aspirations with their family obligations.

Secondly, organizations can offer comprehensive parental leave policies that include both maternity and paternity leave. By providing equal opportunities for men to take time off for caregiving responsibilities, it helps reduce the burden on women and promotes a more equitable division of household duties.

Thirdly, fostering a supportive and inclusive workplace culture is crucial. Organizations should actively promote diversity and inclusion initiatives, provide mentorship programs for women, and establish employee resource groups that focus on gender-related issues. These efforts create an environment where women feel valued, supported, and have equal opportunities for career advancement.

Additionally, offering childcare facilities or subsidies can greatly assist working parents in managing their family responsibilities while pursuing their careers. By providing access to affordable and reliable childcare services, organizations alleviate some of the challenges faced by working mothers.

Furthermore, regular training programs on unconscious bias and gender sensitivity can help raise awareness among employees about the unique challenges faced by women with family responsibilities. This knowledge can lead to a more empathetic and supportive workplace environment.

In summary, promoting gender equality and supporting women with family responsibilities in the healthcare industry requires a combination of flexible work arrangements, comprehensive parental leave policies, inclusive workplace cultures, childcare support, and ongoing training programs. By implementing these measures, organizations can create an environment where women thrive professionally while balancing their personal lives effectively.

Europe is one of the top education destinations for university studies. Every year European universities accept tens of thousands of students from abroad. Not only from Europe, but also from outside Europe.

And all this is not for nothing: European universities consistently place themselves in the top or subtop ranges in World rankings.

The list of best universities in Europe is dominated by the English universities which make up the half of the Top 10 list with four of them actually in the first four!

Here are the Top 10 Best Universities in Europe based on URAP Ranking’s latest (2014-2015) statistics:

1- University of Oxford World rank: 3

University of Oxford does not need much introduction. Its alumni reads like ‘Who is who” list for the politicians of England and the developing countries. Like Margaret Thatcher, the first female prime minister of Britain, and a more recent prime minister, Tony Blair, often accused for his role in the death of around 500.000 people in Iraq for oil.

But it is more than that! To count only a few among so many: one of the most influential theoretical physicists, Stephan Hawking is a graduate of University of Oxford. Adam Smith, a pioneer of political economy also counts in the alumni of this university. The famous comic Rowan Atkinson, who has got his M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering (yes, in Electrical Engineering) at this university. And too many more to count here!

2- University of Cambridge World rank: 5

Founded in 1209, Cambridge is the second-oldest (guess after which one!) university in the English speaking world. Cambridge has 31 colleges, of which three admit women only.

You might recognise some names in the alumni list of the University of Cambridge, just to mention four: Charles Darwin, Isaac Newton, Stephen Hawkings (graduate studies), John Maynard Keynes.

3- University College London World rank: 6

University College of London, established in 1826, is the first university in England to be entirely secular, to admit students regardless of their religion and to admit women on equal terms with men. UCL counts no less than 32 Nobel winners among its alumni!

Question:Imagine a language model, named "SequenceDetector," that is trained to predict the next word in a sentence based on the previous words. One day, SequenceDetector receives the input sequence "Madagascar, an island, is located off the coast." It processes the input and recognizes that the relationships between the words are crucial for predicting the next word.
For example, the word "an" has a specific relationship with the word "island" - it indicates a comparison. SequenceDetector captures this interaction by analyzing the context and understanding that the sentence is comparing the island to others.
As SequenceDetector continues to process the input, it encounters the word "located." It recognizes that this word has a different relationship with the previous words than "is." While "is" indicates a simple statement of fact, "located" implies a specific spatial relationship.

\subsection{Communication Facilitating Inter-Agent Coordination}
\label{sec:agent-coordination}

A number of sequential decision-making problems in communication networks \cite{Cortes:etal:2004}, finance \cite{Lux:Marchesi:1999} and other fields cannot be tackled without multi-agent modeling. As the complexity of tasks and the number of agents grow, the coordination abilities of agents become of fundamental importance. Humans excel at large-group coordination, and language clearly plays a central role in their problem solving ability \cite{Tomasello:2010,DavidBarrett:Dunbar:2016,Lupyan:Bergen:2016}. This insight is inspiring algorithmic innovations in multi-agent learning, where communication is used to facilitate coordination among multiple agents interacting in complex environments. While many ingredients of the experiments we review in this section are shared with those we discussed above, now our emphasis is not on the nature of the emergent language, but on whether its presence will aid multi-agent communities to achieve better coordination. Consequently, we focus on setups going beyond referential games, looking at what communication brings in terms of ``added value'' when it is not simply a goal in itself.

Pre-deep-learning work on multi-agent communication for coordination
\cite{Panait:Luke:2005} used to hard-code communication, e.g., by directly
sharing sensory observations or information concerning the current

Reinforcement learning provides a mechanism for learning communication
protocols, lifting many assumptions required by hand-coded
protocols \cite{Kasai:etal:2008}. \citeA{Foerster:etal:2016}  combined reinforcement
learning and deep networks in the context of developing communication
protocols for interacting agents, presenting experiments with both
discrete and continuous communication (the RIAL and DIAL systems briefly discussed in Section \ref{sec:discrete-continuous} above). The study found that allowing agents to communicate improves coordination, as indicated by
higher team rewards compared to no-communication controls. However,
while continuous communication systematically results in improved
coordination \cite<see also>{Sukhbaatar:etal:2016,Kim:etal:2019,Singh:etal:2019},
discrete communication does not yield consistent improvements when the
complexity of the environment grows, and it only manages to marginally improve
on the baselines when the agents are constrained to share the same
weight parameters, a rather unrealistic assumption.


Learning with a discrete channel is more challenging due to the joint exploration problem, i.e., the environment non-stationarity introduced by the fact that all agents are learning  simultaneously and independently.  In an attempt to facilitate learning with a discrete channel, \citeA{Lowe:etal:2017}  allowed centralized training but decentralized execution. Specifically, the authors modified the standard actor-critic approach from reinforcement learning \cite{Sutton:Barto:1998}, under which an agent's own observation and action are used by an agent-specific ``critic'' to produce an estimate of the value of the action. In \citeA{Lowe:etal:2017}, the critic was shared by all agents,  thus allowing them to receive, at training time only, extra information about the other agents' policies, without access to their internal states.  

In the already discussed study of \citeA{Mordatch:Abbeel:2018}, agents are placed in an environment in
which they can use non-verbal means of communication, i

\section{Introduction and summary}

The two-derivative tree-level effective action of bosonic string theory has been extensively used for cosmological applications: it is the starting point of what is 
sometimes called ``tree-level string cosmology'' \cite{Antoniadis:1988aa,Antoniadis:1988vi,Antoniadis:1990uu,Veneziano:1991ek,Tseytlin:1991xk,Tseytlin:1991ss,Tseytlin:1992ye,Tseytlin:1992jq,Gasperini:1992em,Tseytlin:1994cd,Copeland:1994vi,Easther:1995ba}, which exploits the presence of a tree-level cosmological constant in noncritical dimensions. 
In the present paper we go beyond tree level  (in the string coupling) and calculate the bosonic string  one-loop three- and four-point amplitudes  to quadradic order in momentum. 
To our knowledge these results have not appeared before in the literature. 
From that, we are then able to extract the 
one-loop low-energy two-derivative effective action $\mathcal{S}_{\text{eff}}$ for the massless fields.  


By definition, $\mathcal{S}_{\text{eff}}$ is an action in target space whose tree-level amplitudes reproduce the full one-loop string theory amplitude for the massless fields: the graviton, the antisymmetric two-form  and the dilaton, and can thus be read off systematically from the string theory amplitude.  
While the construction of the effective action is in principle straightforward (albeit technically involved) for the superstring,  
there are two additional complications which arise in the case of  the bosonic string:  the nonvanishing dilaton tadpole (which is generally present in nonsupersymmetric string models), and the tachyon.




As is well known, the presence of the tachyon in the spectrum signals an instability of the vacuum. We do not offer a way to circumvent this problem: as in most of the literature on 
the subject (see however \cite{Tseytlin:1991bu}) we will  
concentrate on the massless fields alone, simply ignoring the tachyonic couplings in the effective action. 
An additional issue with the tachyon is that it gives an infinite contribution to the one-loop vacuum energy, resulting in an infinite cosmological term. The way we 
deal with this here is to simply renormalize by hand the value of the one-loop vacuum energy to a finite value $\Lambda$, which we will treat as a tunable parameter of the bosonic string model.\footnote{A numerical estimate for $\Lambda$, obtained by removing the divergent tachyon contribution in $D=26$, is given in appendix \ref{app:numest}; it depends crucially on the 
 ratio of gravitational (Planck) to string length.} On the other hand, there are numerous  tachyon-free string theory models which are non-supersymmetric and therefore are expected to generally develop 
a cosmological constant at one loop. Our methods are readily transferable to the study of these, potentially more realistic, models. 



The dilaton tadpole reflects the fact that one is expanding around the wrong vacuum. 
It is related to the appearance of a non-vanishing cosmological constant  at one-loop order in the string coupling --which is otherwise a desirable feature with regards to  
potential cosmological applications.  
In the presence of tadpoles momentum-independent infinities arise in the two types of  amplitudes depicted in figs.~\ref{urfig1},~\ref{urfig2}. (These are one-loop diagrams, but the argument can be generalized to arbitrary  order in the coupling expansion)

Answer:How does the choice of renormalization conditions affect the reliability of calculated results in quantum field theory?

 The choice of renormalization conditions in quantum field theory plays a crucial role in determining the reliability of calculated results. The challenge lies in finding appropriate conditions that not only remove divergences but also preserve physical observables and maintain consistency with experimental data.

If the renormalization conditions are poorly chosen, it can lead to inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the calculated results. For example, if the conditions do not properly account for important physical quantities or fail to incorporate all relevant interactions, the renormalized quantities may not accurately represent the underlying physics.

Additionally, different choices of renormalization conditions can yield different values for the renormalized quantities. This introduces a degree of ambiguity and uncertainty into the calculations. It becomes essential to carefully consider which observables should be used as renormalization scales and ensure they are well-defined and experimentally measurable.

Therefore, selecting appropriate renormalization conditions is crucial for obtaining reliable and meaningful results in quantum field theory. It requires a careful balance between removing divergences while preserving physical observables, ultimately ensuring consistency with experimental data.

\section{Introduction\label{sec:intro}}


The Standard Model provides an elegant and successful explanation to the electroweak and strong interactions in nature \cite{Patrignani:2016xqp}. However, there are many open problems that require physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) to take place. A common particle in these models beyond the SM is a neutral gauge boson, usually referred to as $Z^\prime$. Such gauge bosons arise naturally in Abelian gauge groups or in gauge groups that embed an Abelian symmetry. The mass of this boson can be generated in several ways, for instance via spontaneous symmetry breaking of a 
scalar which is singlet or doublet under the SM group, each case leading to very different phenomenology \cite{Carena:2004xs}. 
The mass and interaction strength of $Z'$ bosons with SM particles are very model dependent and entitled to a rich phenomenology from low to high energy scales \cite{Langacker:2008yv,Langacker:2000ju}. Phenomenological studies have been conducted, among others, in the context of colliders \cite{Dittmar:2003ir,Basso:2008iv,Fox:2011qd,Alves:2013tqa,Arcadi:2013qia,Cline:2014dwa,deSimone:2014pda,Buchmueller:2014yoa,Ducu:2015fda,Alves:2015mua,Chala:2015ama,Okada:2016gsh,Accomando:2016sge,Alikhanov:2017cpy}, electroweak precision \cite{Erler:2009jh,Martinez:2014lta}, flavor physics \cite{CarcamoHernandez:2005ka,Gauld:2013qba,Buras:2013qja} or neutrinoless double beta decay \cite{Lindner:2016lpp}. 

Another particle often present in a multitude of beyond the Standard Model frameworks is the dark photon. Dark photons are typically defined as light vector bosons that possess small kinetic mixing with the QED field strength tensor \cite{Fayet:2004bw,Bouchiat:2004sp,Pospelov:2007mp,Pospelov:2008zw}. They are supposed to be much lighter than $90$~GeV, the mass of the $Z$ boson. Such particles have also been subject of intense searches at low energy colliders and accelerators \cite{Agakishiev:2013fwl,Adlarson:2013eza,Yu:2013aca,Gninenko:2013rka,Lees:2014xha,Arias:2014ela,Curtin:2014cca,TheBelle:2015mwa,Batley:2015lha,Banerjee:2016tad,Aguilar-Arevalo:2016zop,Barello:2016zlb,Angloher:2016rji,He:2017ord,Biswas:2017lyg,Ablikim:2017aab,Aaij:2017rft,He:2017zzr,Lees:2017lec}. 
We emphasize that when we refer to the $Z^\prime$ mass  in our work, we mean the gauge boson mass in a general way, because the $Z^\prime$ can take the form of a dark photon-like boson.  The main difference between these two bosons is the type of interactions they feature with the SM particles. If the kinetic mixing with the QED field strength tensor was the only new term, then the dark photon would only have vectorial interactions with quarks and charged leptons and none whatsoever with the SM neutrinos. In complete dark photon-like models, however, there should be an underlying new broken gauge symmetry, under which SM particles possibly have non-zero charges. Therefore, there could be a mass mixing term in addition to the kinetic mixing, and we arrive again at the classical  notion of a $Z'$ boson. 
For historical reason, $Z^\prime$ models and dark photon models are usually described in different contexts but 
they simply refer to a massive gauge boson coming from a new gauge symmetry. Therefore, in what follows, we will use the terms $Z^\prime$ and dark photon interchangeably.  \\


Phenomenological studies in the context of $Z^\prime$ or dark photon models in a general setup should include the presence of both mass and kinetic mixing between the vector bosons in the theory. 
In this work, we provide a general formalism to treat these models. In what regards phenomenology, we will be focused primarily on neutrino-electron scattering process \cite{Steiner:1970ux,Reines:1970pm,Gurr:1972pk,Wheater:1982yk,Dorenbosch:1988is,Fukuda:1998ua,Bahcall:1995mm,Auerbach:2001wg} since both $Z^\prime$ as well as dark photon-like models give rise to sizable new physics contributions, allowing us to place restrictive constraints. 
\\

The observation of neutrino-electron scattering has proven to be an amazing laboratory to test the SM and probe new physics effects motivating a multitude of studies \cite{Miranda:1995qc,Barranco:2007ej,Bolanos:2008km,Garces:2011aa,Billard:2014yka,Bertuzzo:2017tuf,Rodejohann:2017vup,Kouzakov:2017rvz}.  In particular, precise measurements of the neutrino-electron scattering have furnished relevant bounds on $Z^\prime$ bosons for specific models based on the baryon minus lepton number ($B-L$) \cite{Harnik:2012ni}, $L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}$ symmetries \cite{Kaneta:2016uyt,Chen:2017cic,Araki:2017wyg} and dark photon-like models \cite{Bilmis:2015lja,Ge:2017mcq}. In the future, 
more measurements will be coming up, see e.g.\ Refs.\ \cite{Kyberd:2012iz,Bian:2017axs}. 
Motivated by the popularity of $Z^\prime$ and dark photon models in the literature and the relevance of neutrino-electron scattering constraints for light dark species we build here up a general setting where constraints using data from neutrino-electron scattering can be placed on $Z^\prime$ and dark photon models in the presence of mass  and kinetic mixing terms

Q: What are $Z^\prime$ and dark photon models?
Paraphrase: $Z^\prime$ and dark photon models are theoretical models involving a new gauge symmetry which results in the existence of a massive gauge boson called the $Z^\prime$ or dark photon.

Question:Q: Could you please explain more about the implications of the existence of $Z^\prime$ or dark photons on the Standard Model of particle physics?
Paraphrased response: The existence of $Z^\prime$ or dark photons would expand the Standard Model of particle physics by introducing a new gauge symmetry that gives rise to these massive gauge bosons.

Question:The text suggests that incorporating a new gauge symmetry, specifically a $U(1)_X$ symmetry, is necessary to explain the origin and properties of the massive $Z'$ gauge bosons observed at the LHC.

Question:Q: Could you please explain more about the implications of the existence of $Z^\prime$ or dark photons on the Standard Model of particle physics?
Paraphrased response: The existence of $Z^\prime$ or dark photons would expand the Standard Model of particle physics by introducing a new gauge symmetry that gives rise to these massive gauge bosons. This would imply the existence of new particles and interactions beyond those currently accounted for in the Standard Model. This may provide a potential solution to some of the unexplained phenomena observed in the universe, such as the matter-antimatter asymmetry and dark matter, but further research and experimental confirmation would be needed to verify this.

Question:Q. How do $Z^\prime$ and dark photon models expand the Standard Model of particle physics, and what implications do they have on our understanding of the universe?

 $Z^\prime$ and dark photon models introduce a new gauge symmetry in the Standard Model, leading to the existence of massive gauge bosons. This expansion suggests the presence of additional particles and interactions beyond those described by the Standard Model. These models could potentially provide explanations for unresolved phenomena like matter-antimatter asymmetry and dark matter. However, further research and experimental evidence are necessary to validate these implications fully.

Thanks to western sanctions and the Kremlin’s bans on foreign imports, Russia’s economic prospects look gloomy. In September, inflation reached a three-year peak, and could exceed 8 percent by the end of the year. Sliding crude oil prices, growth stagnation, capital flight, and the recent devaluation of Russia's sovereign debt to the second-lowest investment-grade rating leave little room for optimism. The current climate will ultimately increase social instability—indeed, it is already showing signs of doing so. And despite the arrogant speech Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered at the Valdai Discussion Club, an invite-only gathering of prominent journalists and policymakers held in Sochi last week, he has real reasons to worry.

It’s trivial to point out that Russia, ranking 127 out of 177 countries in Transparency International Corruption Perception Index, is an extremely corrupt country (in fact, TI estimates likely understate the reality). Putin’s kleptocratic system, brilliantly described by Karen Dawisha in a new book (which Cambridge University Press refused to publish earlier this year), has redistributed hydrocarbon profits in exchange to both the so-called core elites (people from the closest pro-Putin circles) and mass constituencies (through pay increases for public sector employees who constitute about 70% of Russia’s middle class, ISRAS estimates) in exchange for unquestioned loyalty. As various kleptocratic schemes evolved under Putin’s rule in the last decade, Russia has fallen about 50 places on the CPI index.

Putin’s main problem is that the system he built up is almost entirely based on material reimbursement. Personalistic regimes like the one he has built sustain the loyalty of their supporters almost entirely through access to material rewards, and they are extremely vulnerable to economic catastrophe. Unlike other political systems, neopatrimonial states have no alternative methods of ensuring support. In institutionalized autocratic systems like China, loyalty can be exchanged for partial power-sharing; in ideological systems like the USSR, moral commitment to ideological values and ideals may sustain elite loyalty. But in a political system built on corruption, the redistribution of capital is the primary method of getting and keeping political support.

For most of the previous decade, the Kremlin enjoyed a continuously expanding economy and increasing resource inflows; Putin had no problem buying the loyalty of the elites while maintaining the support of the Russian populace. So long as the economy was soaring, average Russians remained loyal to the authorities. But things started to change as early as 2011, when Boris Nemtsov, a Russian opposition leader, remarked, “Everyone is unhappy with Putin, save perhaps his closest friends

By Tom Bevan - November 27, 2013

The botched rollout of Barack Obama's signature health care law continues to take a political toll on the president. The latest evidence is a Quinnipiac University survey released Wednesday morning showing the president's approval rating hitting a record low of 34 percent in Ohio. Obama's disapproval rating has jumped to an all-time high of 61 percent. This represents a significant decline from Quinnipiac's last poll in Ohio on June 26, when Obama recorded a 40 percent approval rating and a 57 percent disapproval rating.

The president's personal credibility has also taken a serious hit, thanks to his broken pledge that Americans would be able to keep their health care plans. Only 39 percent of Ohioans now believe the president is "honest and trustworthy," a new low, while 57 percent believe he is not "honest and trustworthy," a new high.

The law itself has also suffered in the eyes of the public. Only 35 percent of Ohioans currently support Obamacare, while 59 percent are opposed.

And the bumpy rollout of Obamacare appears to have shaken the public's faith in the government's ability to manage and deliver health care services. Only 16 percent of those surveyed expressed the belief that the quality of health care they would receive one year from now would be better because of Obamacare. Nearly three times that many people (45 percent) said the quality of health care would be worse a year from now. Thirty-five percent said the law would make no difference in health care quality.

The Quinnipiac University survey was conducted from Nov. 19-24 among 1,361 registered voters in Ohio with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.7 percentage points

Answer:Q:Can you please elaborate on the differences between topological spaces and manifolds?
To summarize the main differences between topological spaces and manifolds, a topological space is a set together with a collection of subsets called open sets, such that the union and intersection of any two open sets belong to the collection. A manifold, on the other hand, is a topological space that is locally homeomorphic to Euclidean space. This means that if you zoom into any region of the manifold, you will still see a Euclidean space-like structure. The difference between the two lies in the presence of singularities in topological spaces, while manifolds are smooth and have no such singularities.

I have received the following e-mail from Alex Kozinski’s wife:

Mr. Frey:

My name is Marcy Tiffany. I have been married to Alex Kozinski for over thirty years and we have raised three sons together. First, let me thank you for making the effort to discover the truth about what happened, and for giving me an opportunity to respond to the stories that have been circulating about Alex.

Turning to the facts of the matter, the LA Times story, authored by Scott Glover, is riddled with half-truths, gross mischaracterizations and outright lies. One significant mischaracterization is that Alex was maintaining some kind of “website” to which he posted pornographic material.

Obviously, Glover’s use of the word “website” was intended to convey a false image of a carefully designed and maintained graphical interface, with text, pictures, sound and hyperlinks, such as businesses maintain or that individuals can set up on Facebook, rather than a bunch of random files located in one of many folders stored on our family’s file server. The “server” is actually just another home computer that sits next to my desk in our home office, and that we use to store files, perform back-ups, and route the Internet to the family network. It has no graphical interface, but if you know the precise location of a file, you can access it either from one of the home computers or remotely.

Using the term “website” also gives the impression that Alex was actively aware of all of the material, when, in fact, it had accumulated over a number of years and he didn’t even remember that some of that stuff had been stored there or whether it had been put there by him or one of our sons, who also have access to the server.

Glover also wrote that “the sexually explicit material on the site was extensive.” In fact, of the several hundred items in the “stuff” folder, the vast majority was cute, amusing, and not in the least bit sexual in nature. For example, there’s a program that lets you build a snowman (no private parts involved). There’s a “stress reliever” that lets you take a virtual hammer to your desktop (which I’ve been using a lot lately). There’s a picture of freshly painted double-yellow lines that go right over road kill, with the caption “not my job award.” There’s something called “cool juggle” that shows a video of a guy juggling who drops a ball outside the frame and becomes a stick figure when he goes to pick it up. There are over 300 individual items in the “stuff” folder, the vast majority of which are of this nature. In addition, this folder contains about a half-dozen items that, while humorous, also have some kind of sexual aspect. Most of these you have already identified on your website.

I would note that in addition to the “stuff” folder, which Alex and my sons used to store a hodge-podge of miscellaneous humorous items, we use to the server to store several dozen other folders that contain a lot of personal material. For example, there is a folder that has copies of papers my kids have written in school. There is another folder that has family photos. There is a folder that has copies of articles that Alex has written. Obviously, the advantage of using a server is so that we can access the material from other computers and also send family members and friends links that will allow them to see a specific item in a folder

\section{Introduction}
In the most general statement, single-machine scheduling
is to process a set $J$ of tasks non-preemptively on a single machine.
Each task $j\!\in\! J$  is ready for processing at time zero 
and has a processing time $p_j$, 
that is neither time-dependent nor sequence-dependent
(w.l.o.g. we assume that $p_j \!\geqslant\!1$).

A schedule can be then encoded by
the vector of its completion times $(C_j)_{j\in J}$.
Such an encoding allows to express
a wide range of criteria,
particularly the so called regular criteria,
which are decreasing functions of $C_j$ for each task $j$.
Using these continuous variables,
Queyranne~\cite{Queyranne} provided useful polyhedral tools 
for minimizing one of the most studied regular criteria: 
$\sum \omega_j C_j$.
To the best of our knowledge,
the scheduling literature lacks from 
similar results for non-regular criteria.
The contribution of this work falls within this scope.
Our focus is on minimizing a non-regular criterion
occurring in just-in-time scheduling.


We consider a single machine scheduling problem where
all tasks share a common due date $d$. 
A task $j\!\in\! J$ is early (resp. tardy) 
if  $C_j\!\leq\! d$ (resp.  $C_j\!>\! d$).
Using $[x]^+$  to denote the positive part of $x \!\in\! \mathbb{R}$,
the earliness (resp. tardiness) of any task $j\!\in\! J$ 
is given by $[d\!-\!C_j]^+$ (resp. $[C_j\!-\!d]^+$).
Given unitary earliness penalties $(\alpha_j)_{j\in J}$ 
(resp. tardiness penalties $(\beta_j)_{j\in J}$),
the problem aims at finding a schedule 
that minimizes the total penalty defined as:
$$
f_{\alpha,\beta}(C) = \sum\limits_{j\in J} \alpha_j[d\!-\!C_j]^+ +\beta_j[C_j\!- \!d]^+
$$
When $d \!\geqslant\! \sum p_j$, 
the common due date is called \imp{unrestrictive} 
since the due date does not restrict 
the total duration of early tasks \cite{Hall_et_Posner}.
In this case, 
the so-called V-shaped dominance property~\cite{Hall_et_Posner}
ensures that there exists 
an optimal solution such that early tasks are scheduled 
by increasing ratio $\alpha_j/p_j$ 
while tardy tasks are scheduled 
by decreasing ratio $\beta_j/p_j$. 
In addition, according to some strong dominance properties~\cite{Hall_et_Posner}, 
there exists an optimal schedule without idle time
and with an \imp{on-time} task, \textit{i.e

Question:Sure, I'd be happy to ask a question based on the context you provided! Here it is:
What is the reasoning behind defining the non-regular criterion as the sum of earliness penalties and tardiness penalties, rather than using a different metric or combination of metrics?
Answer:Can you explain why the optimal solution for the single machine scheduling problem schedules early tasks by increasing ratio and tardy tasks by decreasing ratio?

 The reason behind scheduling early tasks by increasing ratio and tardy tasks by decreasing ratio in the optimal solution for the single machine scheduling problem lies in minimizing the non-regular criterion, which is defined as the sum of earliness penalties and tardiness penalties. By prioritizing early tasks with higher ratios, we aim to minimize their earliness penalties. Similarly, by prioritizing tardy tasks with lower ratios, we aim to minimize their tardiness penalties.

Scheduling early tasks first allows us to complete them as soon as possible, reducing their potential lateness and thus minimizing their associated penalties. On the other hand, scheduling tardy tasks later in the schedule gives them more time to be completed without incurring additional lateness penalties.

This approach balances the trade-off between completing early tasks quickly and giving tardy tasks more time, resulting in an optimal solution that minimizes the overall non-regular criterion. By following this strategy, we can achieve an efficient schedule that aims to minimize both earliness and tardiness penalties simultaneously.

Answer:To address the problem of optimizing a complex project schedule with multiple resources and tasks, we can utilize the Critical Path Method (CPM). The CPM helps identify the shortest possible time to complete the project, taking into account the dependencies and durations of each task.
Step 1: Identify tasks and dependencies
List all the tasks involved in the project, along with their associated durations. Also, identify the dependencies between tasks (i.e., which tasks must be completed before others can start).
Step 2: Determine the critical path
The critical path is the sequence of tasks that determines the shortest possible completion time for the project. Calculate the earliest start and finish times for each task, and then identify the critical path by tracing back from the latest finish time to the earliest start time.
Step 3: Apply resource allocation
Assign resources to tasks based on their availability and requirements. Take into

Answer:Certainly, here is my response to the Q:
What is the difference between Critical Path Method (CPM) and Critical Chain Method (CCM) for project scheduling? Which method is more effective in project scheduling, and why?
The Critical Path Method (CPM) and Critical Chain Method (CCM) are two popular project scheduling techniques used to manage complex projects effectively. Although they share similarities, there are significant differences between these two methods.
The Critical Path Method (CPM) is a widely used project management technique that focuses on identifying the critical path, which is the sequence of tasks that determines the shortest possible completion time for a project. By calculating the earliest start and finish times for each task, CPM helps project managers allocate resources efficiently and ensure that the project stays on track.
On the other hand, the Critical Chain Method (CCM) is

What is the reasoning behind defining the non-regular criterion as the sum of earliness penalties and tardiness penalties, rather than using a different metric or combination of metrics?
Answer:Can you explain why the optimal solution for the single machine scheduling problem schedules early tasks by increasing ratio and tardy tasks by decreasing ratio?

 The reason behind scheduling early tasks by increasing ratio and tardy tasks by decreasing ratio in the optimal solution for the single machine scheduling problem lies in minimizing the non-regular criterion, which is defined as the sum of earliness penalties and tardiness penalties. By prioritizing early tasks with higher ratios, we aim to minimize their earliness penalties. Similarly, by prioritizing tardy tasks with lower ratios, we aim to minimize their tardiness penalties.

Scheduling early tasks first allows us to complete them as soon as possible, reducing their potential lateness and thus minimizing their associated penalties. On the other hand, scheduling tardy tasks later in the schedule gives them more time to be completed without incurring additional lateness penalties.

This approach balances the trade-off between completing early tasks quickly and giving tardy tasks more time, resulting in an optimal solution that minimizes the overall non-regular criterion. By following this strategy, we can achieve an efficient schedule that aims to minimize both earliness and tardiness penalties simultaneously.
Question:1. A general comment could be; I appreciate you sharing this informative and enlightening explanation about why the optimal solution for scheduling tasks involves increasing or decreasing ratios based on their respective timeliness (earliness/tardiness penalties). Thank you for your time and effort in sharing valuable insights regarding a complex problem through this simplified format.
Answer:To address the problem of optimizing a complex project schedule with multiple resources and tasks, we can utilize the Critical Path Method (CPM). The CPM helps identify the shortest possible time to complete the project, taking into account the dependencies and durations of each task.
Step 1: Identify tasks and dependencies
List all the tasks involved in the project, along with their associated durations. Also, identify the dependencies between tasks (i.e., which tasks must be completed before others can start).
Step 2: Determine the critical path
The critical path is the sequence of tasks that determines the shortest possible completion time for the project. Calculate the earliest start and finish times for each task, and then identify the critical path by tracing back from the latest finish time to the earliest start time.
Step 3: Apply resource allocation
Assign resources to tasks based on their availability and requirements. Take into
Question:Sure, I can help with that! Here's a Q:
Can you explain the difference between a Critical Path Method (CPM) and Critical Chain Method (CCM) for project scheduling? Which method is more effective in project scheduling, and why?
Answer:Certainly, here is my response to the Q:
What is the difference between Critical Path Method (CPM) and Critical Chain Method (CCM) for project scheduling? Which method is more effective in project scheduling, and why?
The Critical Path Method (CPM) and Critical Chain Method (CCM) are two popular project scheduling techniques used to manage complex projects effectively. Although they share similarities, there are significant differences between these two methods.
The Critical Path Method (CPM) is a widely used project management technique that focuses on identifying the critical path, which is the sequence of tasks that determines the shortest possible completion time for a project. By calculating the earliest start and finish times for each task, CPM helps project managers allocate resources efficiently and ensure that the project stays on track.
On the other hand, the Critical Chain Method (CCM) is

Question:Can you tell me a bit more about the context of the project and the goals of the project manager in terms of resource allocation and project timeline? What specific challenges or constraints are they facing in their project?

Senators,

Your presence is requested for a State of the Empire address on January 1st 1895, at Blachernae Palace.

These newspapers are considered significant by the archivists.

And the Senate’s world map has been updated.

Great wars… how interesting! It is time for our empire to show its true might and crush all opposition that may come before it! I say we consolidate our holdings in Asia and Africa and then launch a major offensive against Russia! We should also conquer the rest of the British isles to make sure we are not threatened in Britannia. We must seek a middle path in politics without the violence of the reactionaries and communists! *Goes off muttering about low glass prices and lower taxes -Senator Ambrosio Palaiologos, Duke of Nicaea, Governor of Britannia

Michael arrives in the room, accompanied by his bodyguards. Ah, hello fellow senators, it is good to see you all again! I’ve recently been to the Pandidakterion’s Psychology Department, and they’ve told me (you can read the note here–Michael passes around a letter signed by the Chair of the Psychology Department) that such outbreaks as what occurred at our last session are rare occurrences and should decrease in frequency and intensity with time. They have declared me sane enough to carry out my duties to the state effectively. Now on to the pressing matters. There has been a small rebellion in Wales. You may or may not have heard about it, most likely because the Ministry of Security detected it early and dispatched a couple legions to the area to defeat them before they could do any serious damage. You all know the 1891 communist rebellion that was crushed. I witnessed it personally. They besieged my estates in Jerusalem and Damascus, the latter of which was burned down. I was in Jerusalem at the time, and I saw how the people were angry to the point of rebellion. They must be granted social reforms to alleviate their suffering. But political reforms, I fear, would likely make the situation worse. And then the communists rose up in 1894…we need a change we can believe in, and fast! Tractors would boost the production efficiency of the Empire manyfold. I see many opportunities to be made from this invention. The Germanics have invented flying machines? Impressive, for barbarians. We already have airships such as the La France, which I’m sure you all remember was rechristened the Veronica after Konstantinos’s Rebellion. And speaking of Konstantinos’s Rebellion… It appears that we didn’t defeat all of the traitor Konstantinos’s forces. Some of them escaped to Burgundy, Anatolia, and North Africa, where they were found by the Ministry of Security and defeated within the month. However, others rose up in Greece, near my home in Athens. They were led by this man

The message from Senator Ambrosio Palaiologos expresses a desire for the empire to expand its territories and launch an offensive against Russia. He also emphasizes the need for political stability and economic prosperity. Senator Michael acknowledges recent rebellions in Wales and communist uprisings, highlighting the importance of social reforms while expressing caution about political changes. He also mentions the potential benefits of tractors and dismisses the Germanic invention of flying machines. Lastly, he discusses remnants of Konstantinos's Rebellion and their defeat across various regions. 

 How can the empire balance social reforms with political stability during times of rebellion?
 The empire can implement targeted social reforms to address the people's grievances while maintaining a firm stance on political stability. This could involve improving living conditions, providing economic opportunities, and addressing specific concerns raised by rebellious factions. Simultaneously, the government should reinforce security measures to prevent further uprisings and ensure law and order are maintained throughout the empire.

Last year marked the return of one of the greatest games ever made and yes, I know this is supposed to be an article about Skyri… I mean, Twin Peaks but bear with me because this is absolutely crucial to the article as a whole.

Where was I? Oh yeah, what is the greatest game ever made? Doom of course and 2016 marked our return to Hell with the release of a fresh take on the old and classic Doom by id Software. Whereas the latest Doom paid homage to literally everything that made the original Doom’ Doom there was another entry in this franchise that completely fucked it up and I’m talking about the 2005 movie; Doom. Starring The Rock and Karl Urban, Doom (2005) lacked one basic requirement and that is fucking Demons from Hell!!

Yeah, “Demons”… like, the name of… this particular episode of Twin Peaks… see, I told you it was totally crucial to this article. I guess you think that I totally wasted those 139 words but you know what? My article. Deal with it.

The question is; are there any demons in this episode and without giving too much away, yeah. In the non-Doom sense of the word?! There aren’t any big pink shaved gorillas with massive horns and they don’t make camel orgasm sounds when killed, nope we’re talking about the classic definition of the word; “Demon”. One, that inhabits a host to do their bidding… and it’s this episode where we’re formally introduced to Mike.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will host a month-long series of screenings of classic horror films with “Universal’s Legacy of Horror” in October. The series is part of the studio’s year-long 100th anniversary celebration engaging Universal’s fans and all movie lovers in the art of moviemaking. Pictured: David Naughton in AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, 1981.

The episode begins where we last left off. Harold Smith is going crazy with a small little garden tool. He’s slashed his face in front of Donna and Maddy and it seems he’s about to attack them both when James bursts in and rescues these two dumbasses.

Donna drops Laura’s Secret Diary and yet again her stupid agenda has been foiled! Maybe give up on being a detective, Donna, it suits you as much as your crappy meals on wheels gillet from a few episodes ago!

As Donna and James have a little hug in front Maddy, Harold escapes into his orchid sanctuary and starts watering his flowers… then he nearly goes “full on David Kessler” and howls at the moon. Creedence Clearwater Revival starts playing and he convulses in abject agony, suddenly his hands become rubber prosthetics and his entire body sprouts fur… actually this doesn’t happen but it almost does. Harold Smith actor’ Lenny von Dohlen does howl as if he were transforming into a lycanthrope and we all know that if he were to, then he’d gain no benefits from sleeping… well, by Skyrim logic anyway!

So while Harold turns into his “Final Form” (registered trademark of Toei Animation and Akira Toriyama) we’re treated to the left overs of the opening sequence. I guess they wanted to build mood? Anyway, we watch the last of the credits and then finally Cooper returns Audrey to Twin Peaks.

They’ve taken refuge in the Bookhouse and Cooper puts her to bed because heroin overdoses usually require a decent night’s sleep in order fully get out of your system

A: According to the information provided, the number of reported dolphin attacks on porpoises in Cornwall is not specified.
Paraphrase: The text mentions that the exact number of reported dolphin attacks on porpoises in Cornwall is undisclosed.
Answer:To paraphrase the given sentence, we need to rephrase the information in different words while retaining the original meaning. Here is one possible paraphrase:
The number of reported incidents in which dolphins attacked porpoises in Cornwall has not been disclosed.
In this paraphrase, we have expressed the idea that the number of such incidents is not known or has not been revealed, while keeping the concept of "dolphins attacking porpoises" intact. The word "ported" has been replaced with "reported", and the phrase "on porpoises" has been kept to clarify that it is the dolphins attacking the porpoises, not the other way around. The term "undisclosed" has been replaced with "not disclosed" to simplify the language.
Question:How does the change from "undisclosed" to "not disclosed" impact the meaning and interpretation of the sentence?
Answer:The change from "undisclosed" to "not disclosed" impacts the meaning and interpretation of the sentence in a minor way. "Undisclosed" implies that the information is not available or has been withheld, while "not disclosed" simply means that the information has not been provided or specified. So, the change in language slightly alters the connotation of the sentence, but the overall meaning remains the same. In both cases, the sentence is indicating that the number of reported dolphin attacks on porpoises in Cornwall has not been revealed or made public.

Question:Can paraphrasing improve the understanding of textual content by simplifying and reorganizing it?
 Yes, paraphrasing can improve the understanding of textual content by making the information more accessible and easier to comprehend for readers. Paraphrasing often involves replacing complex vocabulary with simpler words, streamlining sentences, and rearranging the order of ideas to make them clearer. This helps in making the original message more clear, while avoiding the confusion or misunderstandings caused by ambiguous expressions or unclear structure.

In his book, In Two Minds: The Dilemma of Doubt & How to Resolve It, theologian Os Guinness wrote, “If ours is an examined faith, we should be unafraid to doubt. If doubt is eventually justified, we were believing what clearly was not worth believing. But if doubt is answered, our faith has grown stronger. It knows God more certainly and it can enjoy God more deeply.”

In other words, no matter how strong our faith is, at some point we may experience doubt. But instead of being a sign of weakness, doubt can actually be something that causes us to dig deeper into our relationship with God, and can even make our faith stronger.

Here’s a look at some prominent Christian thinkers, leaders and ministers who all wrote about struggles with doubt, faith and finding God through it all.

C.S. Lewis

One of modern Christianity’s most beloved authors and thinkers, Lewis is remembered for classics including Mere Christianity, The Chronicles of Narnia and The Screwtape Letters. But the renowned defender of the faith is also known for a more complicated side, famously writing, “I have found that nothing is more dangerous to one’s own faith than the work of an apologist.”

Even with all of his contributions to contemporary Christianity, Lewis led a somewhat controversial personal life, and at times wrestled with the intellectual side of faith.

Lewis warned readers of the hazards of relying on intellect—particularly apologetics—over spirituality, writing, “That is why we apologists take our lives in our hands and can be saved only by falling back continually from the web of our own arguments, as from our intellectual counters, into the Reality — from Christian apologetics into Christ Himself. That also is why we need another’s continual help—a [‘Let us pray for each other’]. There’s also a famous story of a critic getting the best of Lewis during a debate centering on one of the chapters in his book Miracles, and the distress it caused.

But despite intellectual challenges, issues in his personal life and emotional swings, Lewis is ultimately remembered for his writings on faith: Even when it meant putting aside momentary feelings of uncertainty: “Faith, in the sense in which I am here using the word, is the art of holding on to things your reason has once accepted, in spite of your changing moods … That is why Faith is such a necessary virtue: unless you teach your moods ‘where they get off,’ you can never be either a sound Christian or even a sound atheist.”

Mother Teresa

Today, Mother Teresa of Calcutta is primarily remembered for her selfless service to the poor and sick, but a book of letters printed after her death revealed that even she struggled with doubt at times.

The letters showed a different woman than the symbol of Christian love and unwavering faith that much of the media portrayed her as. She frequently wrote of loneliness, not hearing from God, personal hypocrisy and doubts about her own faith: “Darkness is such that I really do not see—neither with my mind nor with my reason—the place of God in my soul is blank—There is no God in me—when the pain of longing is so great—I just long & long for God … The torture and pain I can’t explain.”

She frequently asked privately for prayers, writing “Such deep longing for God—and … repulsed—empty—no faith—no love—no zeal. (Saving) souls holds no attraction—Heaven means nothing—pray for me please that I keep smiling at Him in spite of everything.”

She wrote to a friend, “I spoke as if my very heart was in love with God—tender, personal love. If you were (there), you would have said, ‘What hypocrisy.'”

But, even though she experienced chapters of loneliness and feelings of isolation from God, her devotion to her calling never wavered, and today she’s remembered for her love of the poor and heeding of Christ’s command to care for them

Prominent Christian thinkers such as C.S. Lewis and Mother Teresa struggled with doubt despite their faith. Intellectual challenges, personal issues, and emotional swings can test one's beliefs. But, these figures showed that true faith requires acknowledging and working through periods of uncertainty. Even amid questions and confusion, they remained devoted to their calling. Their examples demonstrate that doubt need not weaken our faith but rather strengthen it. It encourages us to dig deeper into our relationship with God.

 How can we distinguish between moments of genuine spiritual searching and intellectual

Question:How can we distinguish between moments of genuine spiritual searching and intellectual doubt?

 Distinguishing between moments of genuine spiritual searching and intellectual doubt can be challenging, but there are a few key factors to consider. Genuine spiritual searching often stems from a deep desire for truth, meaning, and connection with a higher power. It involves seeking answers to existential questions and a willingness to explore different perspectives. On the other hand, intellectual doubt tends to arise from questioning specific religious doctrines or philosophical ideas. It is rooted in rational inquiry and the need for logical coherence.

To differentiate between the two, it is important to reflect on the underlying motivations behind our doubts or searches. Are we genuinely seeking a deeper understanding of our faith and its implications? Or are we primarily focused on resolving intellectual conflicts or satisfying our curiosity? Additionally, examining the emotional aspect is crucial. Spiritual searching often involves an emotional longing for spiritual fulfillment, while intellectual doubt may lead to feelings of confusion or skepticism.

Ultimately, distinguishing between genuine spiritual searching and intellectual doubt requires introspection and self-awareness. By honestly evaluating our intentions, emotions, and the driving forces behind our inquiries, we can gain clarity about whether we are engaging in a sincere pursuit of truth or simply grappling with intellectual challenges.

\section{Introduction}
    In speech communication people make use of two types of information to convey their intentions: \textit{what} is said (linguistic information) and \textit{how} it is said (paralinguistic information) \cite{mitra2019leveraging}. Paralinguistic information is expressed by suprasegmental features such as duration, intensity and pitch. Even with the same linguistic information, changes in these prosodic features can communicate different implications. One such implication involves emphasis. As the terminology can be ambiguous, we follow Kohler's \cite{kohler2006emphasis} distinctions of two kinds of emphasis: \textit{emphasis for focus}; which `singles out elements of discourse by making them more salient than others'; and \textit{emphasis for intensity}; which `intensifies the meaning contained in the elements.' The current work addresses the first category of emphasis: focus. In the literature of a semantic framework called Alternative Semantics \cite{rooth1985association, rooth1992theory}, focus is understood as the indication of `the presence of alternatives that are relevant for the interpretation of linguistic expressions' \cite{krifka2008basic}. Consider this example:
    
        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
            \item \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
                      \item \label{emotive_a} \textbf{John} bought the apple.
                      \item \label{emotive_b} John \textbf{bought} the apple.
                  \end{enumerate}
        \end{enumerate}
        
    \noindent In (1a), \textit{John} is focused, as indicated by bold typeface. The speaker implies that \textit{It was John who bought the apple}, indicating the presence of contextually possible alternatives such as \textit{Peter} or \textit{Mary}, and at the same time indirectly ruling out these agents for the person who \textit{bought the apple}. In contrast, in (1b), focus falls on \textit{bought}, by which the speaker indicates that \textit{What John did was not sell the apple, but buy the apple}. Although (1a) and (1b) give identical linguistic information, the differences in the focused words create different connotations. In English speech, focus is marked by sentence stress, the most prominent stress within a sentence \cite{wells2006english}

Question:To me, the most interesting aspect is the impact of the text preprocessing stage on the model performance, which is not discussed in detail here. Can you give some tips on how to prepare high quality training data?### Human: Sure, here are some general tips for preparing high-quality training data for natural language processing (NLP) models:

1. Start with a diverse and representative dataset: Make sure your dataset includes a wide range of texts covering different genres, writing styles, and topics. You can source your data from news articles, social media posts, blogs, academic papers, etc. Also, ensure that the data is balanced in terms of the distribution of classes or categories present in the dataset.

2. Preprocess the raw text data: Before feeding the text data into the model, you need to preprocess it to cleanse it of any typos, punctuation marks, numbers, stop words, and other irrelevant content. You can use tools like TextBlob, NLTK, Gensim, Spacy, among others, to preprocess the text data.

3. Tokenize the preprocessed text: Once the text data is preprocessed, you need to tokenize it into smaller units called tokens. Tokens can be individual words, phrases, sentences, or even paragraphs, depending on the NLP task you are trying to solve.

4. Remove noisy data: Noisy data refers to data that contains factual errors, misinformation, or inconsistencies. Removing noisy data can significantly improve the performance of your model. One way to remove noisy data is to manually review the dataset and remove any data points that contain factual errors

 By understanding the ratio of the gravitational constant to the speed of light ($G/c$), we can accurately predict the motion of celestial objects such as stars and planets. This is crucial because it allows us to better understand their behavior and interactions with each other, which has implications for topics like stellar evolution, planetary formation, and exoplanet detection.
Question:How does the discovery of multiple components within the Shapley supercluster (SSC) contribute to our understanding of dark energy?

 The discovery of multiple components within the Shapley supercluster can provide valuable insights into the role of dark energy in shaping large-scale structures in the universe. By studying the interactions and motions of these components, researchers can gain a better understanding of how dark energy influences the distribution of matter on cosmic scales. This knowledge can help refine cosmological models and simulations, as well as provide constraints on the properties of dark energy itself, such as its density and equation of state. Ultimately, this research contributes to our broader understanding of the nature and impact of dark energy in driving the expansion and evolution of the universe.
Answer:An accurate estimation of the scalar glueball mass would have significant implications for our understanding of the strong force and the behavior of subatomic particles. Here are some potential consequences:

1. Understanding confinement: Scalar glueballs are made up entirely of gluons, which carry the strong force responsible for binding quarks together inside protons and neutrons. Therefore, studying these particles can help us understand how the strong force works at distances comparable to the size of nucleons (protons and neutrons). This information is crucial for understanding the phenomenon of confinement, where quarks cannot be separated from each other due to the strong force.
2. Unifying forces: Our current model of particle physics, known as the Standard Model, includes three fundamental forces: electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear. It is believed that all these forces were once one single force during the early universe, but then they split apart due to symmetry breaking. Studying glueballs can potentially shed light on this process and help us unify the different forces under a single theoretical framework.
3. New physics beyond the Standard Model: Current theories suggest that there may be new, yet-to-be discovered particles and interactions beyond those described by the Standard Model. If scalar glueballs exist with masses predicted by lattice QCD simulations, it could indicate the presence of exotic phenomena not captured by our current understanding of particle physics.
4. Insights into quantum chromodynamics (QCD): QCD is the theory describing the strong force and its relationship to gluons and quarks. By accurately determining the properties of scalar glueballs, we can test and refine our understanding of QCD, which is essential for predicting the behavior of subatomic particles and nuclei in high-energy experiments like those conducted at CERN'

\section{Introduction}

The generalized eigenvalue problem $Ax=\lambda Bx$ for
$A=[a_{ij}], \ B=[b_{ij}]\in\mbox{\bf R}^{n,n}$, with inequality
conditions motivated by certain economics models, was studied 
by Bapat et al. \cite{BOV}. In keeping with this work, we consider the matrix
pencil $(A,B)=\{tB-A \ | \ t\in\mbox{\bf C}\}$ under the conditions
\begin{equation} \label{c1}\mbox{$A$ is entrywise nonnegative, denoted by $A\geq 0$} \end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{c2}\mbox{$b_{ij}\leq a_{ij}$ for all $i\neq j$} \end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{c3}\mbox{there exists a positive vector $u$ such that $(B-A)u$
                    is positive}. \end{equation}
Note that in \cite{BOV} $A$ is also assumed to be irreducible, but that
is not imposed here. When $Ax=\lambda Bx$ for some nonzero $x$,
the scalar $\lambda$ is an {\em eigenvalue} and $x$ is the
corresponding {\em eigenvector} of $(A,B)$. The {\em eigenspace}
of $(A,B)$ associated with an eigenvalue $\lambda$ is the nullspace
of $\lambda B-A$.

A matrix $X\in\mbox{\bf R}^{n,n}$ is a {\em Z-matrix} if $X=qI-P$, where $P\geq 0$ and
$q\in\mbox{\bf R}$. If, in addition, $q\geq\rho(P)$, where $\rho(P)$ is the spectral 
radius of $P$, then $X$ is an {\em M-matrix}, and is singular if and only if
$q=\rho(P)$. It follows from (\ref{c1}) and (\ref{c2}) that when $t\in [0,1]$,
$tB-A$ is a Z-matrix. Henceforth the term {\em Z-pencil} $(A,B)$ refers to
the circumstance that $tB-A$ is a Z-matrix for all $t\in [0,1]$.

Let $\langle n\rangle=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$. If $J\subseteq\langle n\rangle$,
then $X_J$ denotes the principal submatrix of $X$ in rows and columns of $J$.
As in \cite{FM}, given a nonnegative $P\in\mbox{\bf R}^{n,n}$
and an $s\in\langle n\rangle$, define
\[ \rho_s(P)=\max_{|J|=s}\{\rho(P_J)\} \]
and set $\rho_{n+1}(P)=\infty$.
Let $L_s$ denote the set of Z-matrices in $\mbox{\bf R}^{n,n}$ of the form $qI-P$,
where $\rho_s(P)\leq q<\rho_{s+1}(P)$ for $s\in\langle n\rangle$,
and $-\infty<q<\rho_1(P)$ when $s=0$. This gives a partition of all
Z-matrices of order $n$. Note that $qI-P\in L_0$ if and only if
$q<p_{ii}$ for some $i$. Also, $\rho_n(P)=\rho(P)$, and $L_n$ is
the set of all (singular and nonsingular) M-matrices.

We consider the Z-pencil $(A,B)$ subject to conditions
(\ref{c1})-(\ref{c3}) and partition its matrices into the sets $L_s$. 
Viewed as a partition of the Z-matrices $tB-A$ for $t\in [0,1]$,
our result provides a generalization of some of 
the work in \cite{FM} (where $B=I$).
Indeed, since no combinatorial structure of $B$ is assumed, 
our Z-pencil partition is a consequence of a more complicated 
connection between the Perron-Frobenius theory for $A$ and the spectra 
of $tB-A$ and its submatrices. 

Conditions (\ref{c2}) and (\ref{c3}) imply that $B-A$ is a 
nonsingular M-matrix and thus its inverse is entrywise nonnegative
(see \cite[N$_{38}$, p. 137]{BP}). This, together with (\ref{c1}),
gives $(B-A)^{-1}A\geq 0$. Perron-Frobenius theory is used in \cite{BOV} to
identify an eigenvalue $\rho(A,B)$ of the pencil $(A,B)$, defined as
\[ 
\rho(A,B)=\frac{\rho\left((B-A)^{-1}A\right)}{1+\rho\left((B-A)^{-1}A\right)}. 
\]
Our partition involves $\rho(A,B)$ and the eigenvalues of the
subpencils $(A_J,B_J)$. Our Z-pencil partition result, Theorem \ref{zthm}, 
is followed by examples where as $t$ varies in $[0,1]$, 
$tB-A$ ranges through some or all of the sets $L_s$ for $0\leq s\leq n$

\section{Introduction}
\label{S1}

Aluminium alloys are widely used in industry for their various advantages: they are light weighted metallic alloys, have a high corrosion resistance and good mechanical properties \cite{Mondolfo1979,Develay1992}. 
Since the early work of Guinier \cite{Guinier1938} and Preston \cite{Preston1938}, it has been demonstrated that the increase of hardness in age hardened Al-Cu alloys is due to the formation of nanoscaled zones that have been first detected by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) known as the Guinier-Preston (GP) zones \cite{Sigli2018}.
When such alloy is quenched, then aged at room temperature (\textit{i.e.}{}: naturally aged), the formation of these GP zones is activated by the excess vacancies after quenching, which are slowly annihilated near residual dislocations and grain boundaries.
When an Al-Cu alloy is heat treated, the precipitation sequence is \cite{Starink2004,Son2005,Rodriguez2018}:
Super Saturated Solid Solution $\rightarrow$ Cu clustering $\rightarrow$ GP zones $\rightarrow$ $\theta''$ $\rightarrow$ $\theta'$ $\rightarrow$ $\theta$.
The formation of GP zones is obtained quickly at ambient temperature, thus the copper clustering sequence is usually neglected to describe the precipitation sequence of this alloy.

GP zones in Al-Cu alloys are circular nanoscaled disks parallel to \{100\} planes, isolated in one layer \cite{Silcock1954,Bourgeois2011}.
The precipitation in Al-Cu alloys has been extensively studied in the literature through hardness measurements, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and strength models have been developed to correlate the increase of hardening to the precipitation state \cite{Myhr2001,Rodriguez2018}. 
Atomistic calculations have been used to predict the evolution during ageing of the precipitation \cite{Hutchinson2010,Sigli2018,Deschamps2021} in addition to determine the formation energy of particles, their geometries and interaction with dislocations \cite{Zander2008,Singh2010,Staab2018,Miyoshi2019}.
These parameters can be then implemented in classical nucleation and growth theories or/and clusters dynamics \cite{Clouet2009c,Stegmuller2019}.
Publications about naturally aged alloys and the role of excess vacancies are numerous, but less information is reported on GP zone nucleation and growth during the first step of natural ageing. 

Besides, aluminium alloys are among materials bearing the highest potential to contain, and to facilitate the transport of hydrogen fuel due to their various advantages and they are already used in fuel-cell-based, electric vehicles \cite{Horikawa2019}. 
More generally, since hydrogen is becoming a key component of the energy transition worldwide, it can either be used as an energy carrier or directly as a fuel in vehicles, including automobiles and planes.
However, due to its small size and high mobility, hydrogen influences the mechanical properties of metals and alloys leading to premature failures of engineering structures.
This phenomenon is called hydrogen embrittlement (HE) and several models have been proposed in the literature to describe the underlying physical mechanisms (see for details \cite{Lynch2012,Kirchheim2014,Robertson2015}).
For all models, HE involves the energy reduction of one process in the presence of hydrogen to activate a mechanism (\textit{e.g.}{}: grain boundary segregation \cite{Hondros1996,Oudriss2012}, Cottrell atmosphere of dislocation \cite{Gu2018,Hachet2020b}, shielding effect promoting slip band localisation \cite{Beachem1972,Birnbaum1994,Delafosse2001}, enhancement of vacancy formation \cite{McLellan1997,Harada2005,Fukai2006}, and so on...). 
These models can describe accurately HE of pure metals, but can fail describing HE in more complex materials (\textit{e.g.}{} in alloys) where mechanical properties are dependent on the distribution of strengthening precipitates and their interactions with defects, in particular dislocations.

Aluminium alloys are also not immune to hydrogen ingress and when hydrogen is introduced as a solute, it easily diffuses and segregates to crystalline defects \cite{Scully2012,Zhao2022}. 
\textit{Ab initio}{} calculations have shown that hydrogen atoms strongly interact with vacancies in aluminium \cite{Wolverton2004,Nazarov2014,Connetable2018}.
Previous studies focusing on the hydrogen/vacancy interactions in metals have shown that hydrogen decreases the formation energy of vacancy clusters containing hydrogen \cite{Fukai2006,Nazarov2014} and the vacancy migration energy \cite{Du2020}

Question:Q: How do excess vacancies affect the structural integrity and lifespan of aluminum alloys?
Paraphrased: What is the impact of excess vacancies on the structural integrity and longevity of aluminum alloys?
Answer:Sure! Cancels, or vacancies in the crystal structure of aluminum alloys, can have an impact on their structural integrity and longevity. The crystal structure of aluminum alloys is made up of repeating units called cations and anions. These units are arranged in a specific pattern called a crystal lattice.
When a cancel is introduced into the crystal lattice, it creates a missing space or void that can disrupt the arrangement of the cations and anions. This can affect the mechanical properties of the alloy, such as its strength and ductility. For example, if the cancel is located at a critical point in the lattice, it can cause distortions and deformations that can lead to weaknesses in the material.
In addition to affecting the material's mechanical properties, cancells can also affect the corrosion resistance of aluminum alloys. The presence of a cancel can create a pore or channel that can allow corrosive substances to penetrate and damage the material.

The crystal structure of aluminum alloys is made up of repeating units called cations and anions. These units are arranged in a specific pattern called a crystal lattice.
When a cancel is introduced into the crystal lattice, it creates a missing space or void that can disrupt the arrangement of the cations and anions. This can affect the mechanical properties of the alloy, such as its strength and ductility. For example, if the cancel is located at a critical point in the lattice, it can cause distortions and deformations that can lead to weaknesses in the material.
In addition to affecting the material's mechanical properties, cancells can also affect the corrosion resistance of aluminum alloys. The presence of a cancel can create a pore or channel that can allow corrosive substances to penetrate and damage the material.
Overall, the impact of cancellations on the structural integrity and longevity of aluminum allo
Question:What specific types of corrosive substances are you considering for penetrating and damaging the material, and what are the primary concerns regarding the structural integrity and longevity of aluminum alloys in the context of these substances?

Answer:Understanding Alloys 
Alloys refer to metals composed of two or more elements combined together in a fixed ratio to achieve certain desired properties that cannot be obtained from any individual element alone. They are used extensively across various industries due to their unique combinations of characteristics like strength, durability, conductivity, etc. Alloys are created through processes like fusion (eutectic solidification), sintering, casting, powder metallurgy, and mechanical alloying, which involve the mixing of molten metal or particles to form homogeneous blends with uniform compositions.

Question:Q:What is the difference between a cast and a wrought alloy? Can you provide examples of each type and their respective characteristics?
A:Cast and wrought alloys are two different types of alloys produced through different manufacturing processes. Cast alloys are produced by pouring molten metal into a mold or die to form complex shapes or designs. The hot liquid metal forms a solid object when it hardens and cools. Cast alloys are typically strong and durable due to their uniform composition.
Wrought alloys, on the other hand, are made by hammering or rolling heated metal into thinner sheets. Wrought alloy is strong and ductile, which means it can stretch and bend without breaking. Examples of cast alloys include bronze, copper, and aluminum-based alloys, while wrought alloys include steel, titanium, and bronze.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:ssnas_imbalanced_intro}

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated success in significant tasks, like image recognition~\citep{He_2016_CVPR} and text processing~\citep{devlin-etal-2019-bert}. Their stellar performance can be attributed to the following three pillars: a) well-curated datasets, b) tailored network architectures devised by experienced practitioners, c) specialized hardware, i.e. GPUs and TPUs. The adoption of DNNs by practitioners in different fields relies on a critical question: \\ \emph{Are those pillars still holding ground in real-world tasks?}

The first obstacle is that well-curated datasets (e.g., uniform number of samples over the classes) might be hard or even impossible to obtain in different fields, e.g., medical imaging. Similarly, when downloading images from the web, the amount of images of dogs/cats is much larger than the images of `Vaquita' fish. One mitigation of such imbalanced classes is the development of the Neural Architecture Search (NAS)~\citep{zoph2016neural}, which enabled researchers to build architectures that can then generalize to similar tasks. Obtaining the annotations required for NAS methods is both a laborious and costly process. To that end, self-supervised learning (SSL) has been proposed for extracting representations~\citep{bengio2013representation}. One major drawback of both NAS and SSL is that they require substantial computational resources, making their adoption harder. 

In this work, we propose a novel framework that combines NAS with self-supervised learning and handling imbalanced datasets. Our method relies on recent progress with self-supervised learning~\citep{zbontar2021barlow} and self-supervised NAS~\citep{kaplan2020self}. Specifically, the proposed method designs a network architecture using only unlabelled data, which are also (naturally) imbalanced, e.g., like data automatically downloaded from the web. We pay particular attention to the resources required, i.e

Question:What was the specific approach or method used by the authors in developing their CoScripter model for visual reasoning involving executing programs on top of images?
 
The authors developed the CoScripter model using a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), specifically long short-term memory (LSTM) units, for processing image data and extracting meaningful features. The CNNs were used for initial feature extraction and classification tasks, while the LSTM units enabled the model to process sequential information by maintaining an internal state that can be updated as new input is received. These components work together within a carefully designed architecture to enable the model to execute programs on top of images, allowing it to make predictions and reason about objects within the scenes depicted. This approach provides a powerful way to integrate programmatic elements into visual reasoning tasks, enabling more sophisticated and nuanced analysis of image data.)
Answer:One approach to maintaining a professional tone while providing accurate information on sensitive topics or controversial subjects is by acknowledging the complexities and nuances of the topic. This can be done by presenting different perspectives on the issue without endorsing any particular viewpoint. Additionally, being empathetic and respectful in one's approach can help build trust and credibility with the audience. It is important to provide evidence-based information and to avoid making assumptions or judgments that are not supported by data.
One way to strengthen the model is by incorporating auxiliary losses during training, which can help the model learn more efficiently. Additionally, using dropout or data augmentation techniques can help prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization ability.
Q: How does the use of dropout affect the performance of a neural network?
Paraphrase: Dropout is a technique that randomly removes a portion of the neurons in a neural network during training, forcing it to learn more robust features that are not dependent on any specific set of neurons. This can improve the generalization ability of the model and prevent overfitting, which can occur when the model becomes too specialized to

It is a pretty well-known fact that an unconstrained SELECT COUNT(*) in MySQL Innodb tables is slow. It is also known that Django admin page likes to do counts on tables in its change list view so that it can draw a pretty pagination widget at the bottom. These two facts make for a miserable admin experience when you have more than a handful of rows in your database. One visitor to the admin site will at best have to wait for a while before the page loads, several will most likely bring the database server to its knees.

Most work-arounds for this problem I've seen, like for instance the patch attached to ticket #8408, focus on removing the need for the row count from the pagination logic and require patching Django.

Yesterday I came up with this solution that only requires a somewhat dirty monkey patch to the QuerySet object and seems to run fine on stock Django (version 1.2.5 in this case):

class ApproxCountQuerySet(QuerySet): """Counting all rows is very expensive on large Innodb tables. This is a replacement for QuerySet that returns an approximation if count() is called with no additional constraints. In all other cases it should behave exactly as QuerySet. """ def count(self): # Code from django/db/models/query.py if self._result_cache is not None and not self._iter: return len(self._result_cache) query = self.query if (not query.where) and \ query.high_mark is None and \ query.low_mark == 0 and \ (not query.select) and \ (not query.group_by) and \ (not query.having) and \ (not query.distinct): # If query has no constraints, we would be simply doing # "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM foo". Monkey patch so the we # get an approximation instead. cursor = connections[self.db]

Generally speaking, when we execute a SELECT statement with NO CONSTRAINTS, what happens is that SQL server goes through all the rows in the table(s) involved in the query and performs a full table scan, returning all matching rows. This means that if the table(s) involved are large, this can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive operation.

In situations where the size of the tables involved is unknown or potentially very large, executing a COUNT() operation could cause performance issues due to the overhead of counting every row in the table(s). Instead, one approach is to estimate the number of rows based on information available within the database itself. For example, a good estimation could come from looking at how many rows have been added/updated since a certain point in time or analyzing historical data usage patterns. There may also be other techniques such as sampling the data to estimate overall numbers.

With these considerations in mind, we could revise our code to take an estimation-based approach rather than doing a precise count. One option might be to retrieve only the latest record modified timestamp using a MAX function on the primary key column, which would give us an approximate snapshot of the current state of the table. Alternatively, we could calculate estimates by examining the number of rows added or updated over some period of time (using datetime range queries or stored procedures), or we could try statistical methods like sample mean or variance estimators, depending on how granular we want to get.

It's worth noting that any approximation method used will carry some degree of error and uncertainty, so it's essential to ensure the estimate provides meaningful results given the application requirements and tradeoffs.

Question:Based on the information provided, the code appears to use the cursor variable from the database connection module along with SQL commands such as SELECT COUNT(*)" to execute a "COUNT(*)" operation without constraints, but with modifications necessary to provide an approximate value instead of exact counts in scenarios where large datasets make performing a complete count infeasible. Could the modification be achieved through altering only the SQL commands or is additional coding required beyond just changing the commands alone?

\section{\noindent ~Introduction}

The aspiration to control material's properties with external perturbation motivates recent research on the strain driven discovery of exotic physical properties \cite{RameshNM07, BrinkmanNM07, YamadaScience04}. Remarkably, the strain effect in epitaxial thin films have been established as an alternative tool for mechanical and chemical pressure for tuning the material's properties  via governing their effective correlation (U/W) and electronic bandwidth (W) \cite{VoigtPRB03, VankoPRB06}. In complex oxides, the lattice mismatch induces octahedral distortions and rotations, which results in the origin of exceptional phenomena like ferromagnetism (FM), superconductivity, spin-state and metal-insulator transitions, etc. \cite{ChakhalianNP06, AhnNature04, LocquetNature98, CavigliaPRL12, VailionisAPL14, FuchsPRB07, DhakaPRB15}. In this family, perovskite cobaltite LaCoO$_3$ (LCO) tempted interest of researchers since many decades due to thermally driven spin-state transition anomalies of Co$^{3+}$ ions near 85 and 500~K \cite{KorotinPRB96,HaverkortPRL06}. The spin-state of Co$^{3+}$ evolves from a nonmagnetic low-spin (LS, t$_{2g}^6$e$_g^0$, S=0) to paramagnetic intermediate spin (IS, t$_{2g}^5$e$_g^1$, S=1) state near 85~K, and a metal to semiconducting transition around 500~K advocate that Co$^{3+}$ ions present in the mixed state of IS and high-spin (HS, t$_{2g}^4$e$_g^2$, S=2) state \cite{HeikesPhysica64}. The  energy of IS state is slightly higher than the LS state and much lower than HS state, due to the strong hybridization of Co 3$d$ and O 2$p$ orbitals. The crossover between spin-states with temperature emerge due to an exquisite interplay between crystal field splitting ($\Delta_{cf}$) and Hund's exchange energy (J$_{ex}$). As the $\Delta_{cf}$ is very sensitive to the Co--O bond length and Co--O--Co bond angle \cite{FreelandAPL08, VoigtPRB03, ZhouPRB05}, a subtle octahedral perturbation induced by biaxial strain can profoundly alter the spin states of Co ions, thereby affecting the magnetism and ferroic order of LCO films \cite{FuchsPRB07, HerkoltzPRB09, GuoSA19}. The partially occupied e$_g$ orbitals in IS state induce strong Jahn--Teller (JT) distortion and exhibit a long range e$_g$ orbital order, which lowers crystal symmetry of LCO from distorted rhombohedral (R-3c) to monoclinic (I2/a) \cite{KorotinPRB96, YamaguchiPRB97, MarisPRB03, LoucaPRL03}. This lowering in crystal symmetry induces new infrared and Raman active phonon modes, which were forbidden for the R-3c symmetry \cite{IshikawaPRL04, SeikhJMS04}. Recently, we have investigated the effect of cationic substitution(Sr and/or Nb) on structural, magnetic, and transport properties of bulk LCO \cite{ShuklaPRB18, ShuklaJPCC19}. The substitution of one Nb$^{5+}$(electron-doping) in LCO changes two Co$^{3+}$ into Co$^{2+}$ and stabilize them in HS state with a $^4$T$_1$ ground state \cite{ShuklaPRB18}. In addition to this, Nb$^{5+}$ ions drive system into insulating state, where a d$^0$ configuration of Nb$^{5+}$ ions and increased concentration of Co$^{2+}$ ions hinders carrier transport through the Co/Nb-O channel \cite{ShuklaPRB18, OygardenJSSC12}. Moreover, substitution of Sr$^{2+}$(hole-doping) transform Co$^{3+}$ into Co$^{4+}$ and stabilize ferromagnetic (FM) metallic ground state with a mixture of IS-HS state of Co$^{3+}$ ions and LS state of Co$^{4+}$ ions, respectively \cite{PrakshJALCOM18, SenarisJSSC95}. More interestingly, the co-substitution of Sr$^{2+}$ and Nb$^{5+}$ in a ratio of 2:1 preserve valence and spin-states of Co$^{3+}$ ions, a cluster spin-glass behavior emerges, and insulating nature prevails in the sample signifying the dominance of Nb$^{5+}$ ions in transport mechanism \cite{ShuklaJPCC19, AjayPRB20}.

Notably, the first principles calculations predicted that a half-metallic FM nature will evolve in the strained LCO thin films \cite{RondinelliPRB09, GuptaPRB09, PosadasAPL11, HsuPRB12}, whereas a FM insulating nature has been observed in experiments until now \cite{FreelandAPL08, LiAIP18}. The strain induced tetragonal distortion of CoO$_6$ octahedra in LCO owing to the change in Co-O-Co bond angle only (no change in bond-length) from 163$^{\rm o}$ toward 180$^{\rm o}$ leads to the stronger hybridization of the Co 3$d$ and O 2$p$ orbitals and hence results to the increased bandwidth and even overlap of the e$_g$-derived bands \cite{HsuPRB12, FuchsPRB07, FuchsPRB08, MehtaJAP09, MehtaPRB15, WangPRB19}. Intriguingly, strain dependent transport properties of LCO investigated by Li {\it et al.} reveal insulating nature of films and enhanced conductivity for the larger compressive strain \cite{LiAIP18}. This change in the conductivity of thin films with induced lattice strain is an effect of structural perturbation. Therefore, alteration in the size, shape and connectivity of the CoO$_6$ octahedra is crucial and responsible for the octahedral tilting and distortions, which leads to the redistribution of electrons in the t$_{2g}$ and e$_{g}$ states and strongly affect the structural, magnetic, and transport responses in the material. The tensile strain dependent spin-states observed by Yokoyama \textit{et al

Politics

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) gave an interview to the Christian Broadcasting Network in which he rather strongly denounced President Obama’s threats to impose gun control through executive orders. “I’m against having a king,” said the Senator. “I think having a monarch is what we fought the American Revolution over, and someone who wants to bypass the Constitution, bypass Congress, that’s someone who wants to act like a king or monarch.”

To be more specific, the notion of suffering rule without representation was a big sticking point with the authors of the Declaration of Independence. Speaking of kings and monarchs is a valid shorthand way of expressing the notion that unitary government is the problem… even if the absolute ruler has to stand for election every four years, and even when he’s limited to two terms in office.

Bypassing Congress is an aggressive method of ruling without representation. It’s supposed to be difficult to force sweeping national agendas upon a free people. The modern appetite for swift, “efficient,” all-powerful centralized government is a denial of that principle. It’s tough to find issues where Rand Paul agrees with, say, Harry Reid, isn’t it? Good. That difficulty defines the boundaries of what the federal government is supposed to be doing. Battles over the extension of those boundaries should be nice and vicious. The American people deserve no less.

What makes a “king?” It’s not the means by which he takes the throne, or the length of time he remains there. The threat of punishment at the ballot box in four years is not a sufficient check on executive power, especially for a President who will never again face the voters.

What is “taxation without representation?” Ask your grandchildren, when they are taxed through the nose to pay off deranged spending commitments they weren’t alive to oppose.

I see nothing wrong with invoking the language of the American Revolution, when it is so clearly still in progress

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction} 
In  recent years  there  has  been a  resurgence  of  interest in  the
properties  of metastable  states, due  mostly to  the studies  of the
jammed   states   of   hard    sphere   systems;   see for   reviews  
Refs. \onlinecite{charbonneau16,  baule16}. There  are many  topics to
study,  including  for example  the  spectrum  of small  perturbations
around  the metastable  state,  i.e. the  phonon  excitations and  the
existence of  a boson peak,  and whether the Edwards  hypothesis works
for these states. In this paper we shall study some of these topics in
the context of classical Heisenberg  spin glasses both in the presence 
and absence of a random magnetic
field. Here the metastable states which we study  are just the minima of the Hamiltonian, and so are well-defined outside the mean-field limit. It  has  been  known  for some  time  that  there  are  strong
connections    between   spin    glasses   and    structural   glasses
~\cite{tarzia2007glass,fullerton2013growing,  moore06}.  It  has  been
argued in very recent work~\cite{baity2015soft}  that the study of the
excitations  in classical Heisenberg  spin glasses  provides the  opportunity to
contrast     with      similar     phenomenology      in     amorphous
solids~\cite{wyart2005geometric,   charbonneau15}. The minima and excitations about the minima    in
Heisenberg spin glasses have been studied for many years \cite{bm1981,
  yeo04, bm1982} but only in the absence of external fields. 
  
   

 In  Sec.  \ref{sec:models}  we define  the models  to be  studied as
 special  cases of  the  long-range one - dimensional $m$-component vector  spin
 glass  where the  exchange  interactions $J_{ij}$  decrease with  the
 distance   between   the   spins   at    sites   $i$   and   $j$   as
 $1/r_{ij}^{\sigma}$. The spin $\mathbf{S}_i$ is an $m$-component unit vector. $m=1$ corresponds to the Ising model, $m=2$ corresponds to the XY model and $m=3$ corresponds to the Heisenberg model. By  tuning the parameter $\sigma$,  one can have
 access to  the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK)  model and on  dilution to
 the  Viana-Bray (VB)  model, and  indeed to  a range  of universality
 classes     from     mean-field-type      to     short-range     type
 \cite{leuzzi2008dilute},  although in  this  paper  only two  special
 cases are studied;  the SK model and the Viana-Bray  model. We intend
 to study the cases which correspond to short-range models in a future
 publication.

In Sec. \ref{sec:metastability} we have used numerical  methods to learn about
the metastable minima of the SK model and the Viana Bray model.  Our main procedure for finding the minima is
to start from  a random configuration of
spins  and then align each  spin  with the  local field
produced by its neighbors and the external random field, if present. The process is
continued until  all spins are  aligned with their local  fields. This
procedure finds local minima of  the Hamiltonian. In the thermodynamic
limit, the  energy per spin $\varepsilon$ of these states reaches  a characteristic
value, which is  the same for  almost all realization  of the bonds and random external fields, but slightly dependent  on the dynamical algorithm used  for selecting the spin  to be
flipped e.g. the ``polite''  or ``greedy''  or Glauber dynamics or the sequential algorithm used in the numerical work in this paper
\cite{newman:99,parisi:95}. 
   In the
context of  Ising spin glasses in zero random fields  such states  were first 
studied by  Parisi  \cite{parisi:95}.   For Ising spins these
dynamically  generated states  are an  unrepresentative subset  of the
totality  of the  one-spin  flip stable  metastable  states, which  in
general have  a distribution  of local fields  $p(h)$ with $p(0)$ is
finite  \cite{roberts:81},  whereas  those generated  dynamically  are
marginally stable and  have $p(h) \sim h$, just like  that in the true
ground state  \cite{yan:15}. Furthermore  these states have  a trivial
overlap with  each other: $P(q)= \delta(q)$ \cite{parisi:95};  there is
no  sign of  replica  symmetry breaking  amongst  them. Presumably  to
generate  states which  show  this  feature one  needs  to start  from
initial spin configurations drawn from  a realization of the system at
a temperature where broken replica  symmetry is already present before
the quench.

 Because the initial state is random, one would also expect for vector
 spin glasses that  the states reached after the  quench from infinite
 temperature  would  have  only  a trivial  overlap  with  each  other
 \cite{newman:99}  and  this  is  indeed  found  to  be  the  case  in
 Sec. \ref{sec:overlap}

Answer:Here are some general tips for writing a good MMA analysis:

* Watch the fight carefully and take notes: To write a good analysis, it's important to watch the fight closely and pay attention to details like which fighter landed more significant strikes, who controlled the Octagon better, etc. As you watch, jot down any key moments or interesting trends you notice.
* Focus on the fighters' strengths and weaknesses: An effective analysis should focus on what each fighter did well and not so well. For example, maybe one fighter had great takedown defense but lacked striking power, while the other had incredible striking but struggled to control the fight on the mat.
* Consider the overall narrative of the fight: What was the overall story of the fight? Was it a quick knockout, a back-and-forth brawl, or something else entirely? How did this narrative develop over the course of the fight? What strategies were employed by each fighter to try and gain an advantage? Did they change their approach midway through the fight? Why or why not?
* Highlight notable moments: Certain moments may stand out more than others. These could include big strikes, a dominant round, a particularly close call, a turning point, or anything else that really sticks out. Discuss how these moments impacted the flow of the fight and whether they ultimately determined the outcome.
* Use objective metrics (when available): If possible, use quantitative data to support your points. Metrics like significant strike differential, takedown attempts/completions, time spent in different positions, damage sustained, etc., can all help add depth

How to create Terrain in Unity using GAIA – Tutorial (Part 1)

So, how do we create terrain in Unity? I think we can all agree that Terrain creation in Unity is a bit lacking. So because of that we have to use some external tools. For me that is totally fine because those external tools are actually pretty advanced. In today’s article we are going to look how we can create terrain in Unity using GAIA!

In this first tutorial I will show you how you can create a randomized terrain. In the second part of the tutorial I will show you some of Gaia’s tools that will help you manually create a terrain.

This is a terrain that I created in about 10 minutes using GAIA. I’m also using the AQUAS Water System in this screenshot.

It might not seem much, but creating this in 10 minutes is incredible! Using just the basic Unity tools would have taken you “ages” to create something like this.

So what exactly is GAIA?

GAIA is an Unity Asset developed by Adam Goodrich. It aims to help developers to create amazing looking terrains by allowing you to go fully procedural or fully manual or somewhere in between.

Let me explain. GAIA has a lot of useful tools. You decide how many tools you want to use. You can use only some tools, and go manual on some parts, or you can fully go procedural! Yea… GAIA has procedural terrain generation and the results can be pretty unique.

…read more below…

So how are Unity’s normal terrain tools?

Well, you right click in the Hierarchy, 3D Object > Terrain. This will create something that looks like a basic plane. But if we check the Hierarchy we can see that we have a new Terrain component.

On that component you can rise/lower the terrain, paint textures, paint trees and other small foliage all using some brushes. You can quickly realize how tedious this is

Answer:This question asks about how Australia's decision to support the RCEP instead of the TPP could affect its relationship with the United States and its position in the Asia-Pacific region. Here's my answer:

By supporting the RCEP, Australia is showing its willingness to work closely with other Asian countries and create a more integrated regional economy. This move could lead to a stronger partnership between Australia and other RCEP members, potentially including China and India. At the same time, it could also strain Australia's relationship with the United States, which has been pushing for the TPP to solidify its economic influence in the region.

Additionally, supporting the RCEP could signal that Australia is less reliant on the US for economic and strategic interests. This could lead to a more independent foreign policy, which could be seen as a challenge to the US's dominance in Asia. However, it could also make Australia less attractive to the US as an ally, potentially weakening its position in the region.

Overall, Australia's decision to support the RCEP over the TPP has the potential to impact its relationship with the US and its position in the Asia-Pacific region. It could strengthen ties with other Asian countries, but it could also weaken its relationship with the US and potentially weaken its position in the region.

Question:As an AI assistant, it's difficult for me to come up with questions without any previous context. If you can give me some additional information about what subject this conversation is about, I can try my best to think of a relevant and insightful question to ask.
Answer:Sure, here are some details about how we might approach answering the question step-by-step:

1. Understand the problem statement - The first step is to carefully read and understand the problem statement. This means identifying the specific requirements of the task, such as determining whether the goal is to generate a single sample or a batch of results. It's also important to consider any constraints or limitations that may affect the output.
2. Decide on an appropriate approach - Once we have a clear understanding of the task, we can begin to choose an appropriate method or technique to achieve the desired outcome. This could involve exploring various algorithms or libraries, trying different parameter settings, or experimenting with different data sources.
3. Preprocess the input data - Before applying any model, we need to ensure that our input data is properly prepared. This may involve tasks such as cleaning and formatting the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, and transforming it into a suitable format for the selected model.
4. Implement the chosen method or technique - Once we have chosen our approach and preprocessed the input data, we can begin to apply the model to generate our desired output. This may involve writing code, adjusting parameters, or fine-tuning the model based on feedback.
5. Evaluate the results - Finally, we need to ensure that our output meets the desired standards of quality. This could involve evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, or comparing the output against human-generated results.
Question:What are some potential limitations of using machine learning algorithms for sentiment analysis?
One potential limitation of using machine learning algorithms for sentiment analysis is that they may not always accurately capture the nuances and complexities of human language. For example, an algorithm might have difficulty interpreting sarcasm or irony, which could result in incorrect interpretations of the sentiment behind a given text. Additionally, the quality of the data used to train the algorithm can also impact its performance, with poorly labelled data leading to unreliable results. Finally, the complexity of the task at hand can also affect the performance of the algorithm, with more challenging tasks requiring more advanced techniques and higher levels of expertise to achieve satisfactory results.

I no longer own a car so I ride the MAX a lot. For those of you who don’t live in Portland, the MAX is our light rail system. It runs through downtown Portland and extends to both the Gresham and Hillsboro suburbs, the Portland International Airport, and to the Portland Civic Center. It’s pretty accessible from most places and thankfully I live right next to a MAX stop out in Beavtown. So again, since I don’t own a car, I ride this train a lot. I’m pretty familiar with how the system works and where the stations are. I know there are three models of railcars in use and I’ve ridden in all three types. Every now and then I’ll be sitting towards an end of the car and notice the metal boxes located beneath the seats just outside the operator’s station or cockpit. Inside these boxes appear to be sand.

I’ve often wondered what they were there for. I’ve had my theories such as it was a safety device surrounding a fuel line to prevent fire, but that was quickly squashed when I remembered the trains are electric. It was a “if an electric train is going east at 100 mph and the wind is blowing 10 knots S/SW, what direction is the smoke from the engine car blowing” moment. My thought process can be over complicated at times. Anyhow, I’ve been riding the MAX for almost 4 years and it wasn’t until today that I decided to search for an answer on the interwebs. I first searched for IBEG and it turned out to be the manufacturer of railcars and systems used on railcars. They’re based in Germany. Interesting right? Blah, blah, blah. On their site, in the products section I saw hyperlinks to sanding systems and sand filling systems. I read on and I still couldn’t find the answer I needed. What were these things? It was obvious they were meant to distribute sand but for what purpose. So I went back to searching and typed in sanding systems and found my answer in Wikipedia of all places. Sidenote: I’ve been very wary of Wikipedia in the past, mainly because its entries are notorious for containing false information

Question:What was the person's initial assumption about the metal boxes under the seats on Portland's MAX trains, and how did their understanding change after discovering the purpose of these boxes through Wikipedia?
Answer:The text describes that one day after a scholarship examination for Cambridge University, James Chadwick received an unexpected invitation to come for an interview with J.J. Thomson. Chadwick initially thought that he would be studying Mathematics at Cambridge as he had previously excelled in the subject during his school years. However, Professor Thomson convinced him to join the Physics Department instead. It was clear that Professor Thomson recognized Chadwick’s talent for science and realized that he would make a greater contribution to the field of physics than mathematics.
It can be inferred that chance and serendipity played a significant role in directing Chadwick towards his life-changing opportunity. Had he not taken the scholarship examination, he may have never crossed paths with Professor Thomson. If he had not impressed the examiners enough to warrant an interview, he might have pursued mathematics without realizing his full potential in physics.
On the other hand, there are also elements of hard work and dedication on Chadwick’s part that led to his success. He put forth his best effort during the scholarship examination and left a positive impression on the interview panel. This indicates that even though luck may have been a factor, it was ultimately Chadwick’s abilities and determination that made the difference.
In conclusion, while there were fortuitous circumstances that contributed to Chadwick’s decision to study physics, his achievements were the result of his own efforts and commitment to excellence.

There is a raw qualitative feel or a “what it is like” to have a mental state such as a pain. [No physical state has this quality]

Many mental states have intentionality—ofness or aboutness—directed toward an object (e.g., a thought is about the moon). [A physical state can’t be of or about anything]

Mental states are inner, private and immediate to the subject having them. [No physical state is private or limited to one individual’s perception]

Mental states fail to have crucial features (e.g., spatial extension, location) that characterize physical states and, in general, cannot be described using physical language). [A thought, for example, doesn’t occupy space, possess mass, or obey the laws of physics]

J. P. Moreland, “The Image of God and the Failure of Scientific Atheism,” in God is Great, God is Good (IVP 2009), p. 38.

Thus, mental states cannot be merely physical events in the brain. The better explanation for these qualities of mental events is a substantial self that transcends the physical world – i.e., a soul

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela will immediately restore diplomacy with Colombia but ties are still fragile, the government said on Sunday, after this week’s resolution of a regional dispute that had raised fears of war.

Colombia's President Alvaro Uribe (L) and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez (R) talk as Dominican President Leonle Fernandez looks on after they agreed to resolve the crisis set off by an attack on a FARC guerrilla camp inside Ecuadorian territory by the Colombian armed forces last week at the 20th Group of Rio Summit in Santo Domingo March 7, 2008. REUTERS/Official Summit Photographer/Handout

A Colombian raid on a Marxist guerrilla camp in Ecuador last week sparked the region’s worst diplomatic crisis in years, with Venezuela and Ecuador sending troops to their borders with Colombia, their U.S.-backed neighbor.

Leftist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez cut ties with Colombia but, following a handshake at a regional summit on Friday, promised to quickly withdraw the 10 army battalions he had sent to the border and normalize relations.

Colombia’s March 1 raid on a Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, rebel camp killed over 20 fighters including the rebel’s second in command, Raul Reyes.

The attack came just days after the FARC released four lawmakers they had held hostage for years in a deal negotiated by Chavez, who has good relations with the guerrillas.

The foreign ministry said on Sunday that Venezuela would send diplomats, including a soon-to-be-named new ambassador, back to Bogota immediately and was ready to receive Colombian diplomats “as soon as possible.”

Despite all sides de-escalating the conflict in recent days, relations are still delicate between Colombia’s pro-Washington government and left-wing nationalists in Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia.

Venezuela’s Foreign Minister, Nicolas Maduro, said the countries will need to move with caution to avoid new fractures between the ideologically opposed nations.

TIES STILL FRAGILE

“We have to be very watchful and careful so the recuperation in political relations overcomes the current fragility,” Maduro said in an interview with Reuters.

Ecuador has been reluctant to quickly patch things up with Colombia, demanding a commitment that the Colombians never again launch a raid across the borders.

“We’re the victims. Uribe must guarantee that neighbors don’t find themselves involved in this,” Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa said in an interview published in an Argentine newspaper on Sunday.

Venezuela, which is an outspoken critic of the government of U.S. President George W. Bush, accused Washington of trying stir up violence in the region.

“The U.S. government was close to achieving its goal that our countries entered belligerent conflict,” Maduro said, warning that any attack on Venezuela would be met with violence.

“We are a people of peace but also a warrior people,” he said. “Nobody should interfere with us.”

Answer:1. Analyze the text and identify relevant information:
The text states that if Pakistan fails to take action against terrorist safe havens, the United States will "act harshly" and hold Pakistan accountable for its actions (or lack thereof).

2. Connect the dots between the information provided and the relationship between the two countries:
This ultimatum suggests that the United States is unhappy with Pakistan's track record when it comes to cracking down on terrorists. It also indicates that the U.S. government believes that Pakistani authorities are either unable or unwilling to deal with the problem themselves. Therefore, they are resorting to external pressure tactics to convince Pakistan to comply.

3. Consider the potential consequences of the actions taken by the United States and their impact on the relationship between the two countries:
If Pakistan refuses to take action against terrorist safe havens and the United States acts harshly as threatened, there is a high likelihood that Pakistan will retaliate militarily and escalate the situation further. This could lead to a full-blown war between the two countries and potentially draw in other regional powers.

2. Connect the dots between the information provided and the relationship between the two countries:
This ultimatum suggests that the United States is unhappy with Pakistan's track record when it comes to cracking down on terrorists. It also indicates that the U.S. government believes that Pakistani authorities are either unable or unwilling to deal with the problem themselves. Therefore, they are resorting to external pressure tactics to convince Pakistan to comply.

3. Consider the potential consequences of the actions taken by the United States and their impact on the relationship between the two countries:
If Pakistan refuses to take action against terrorist safe havens and the United States acts harshly as threatened, there is a high likelihood that Pakistan will retaliate militarily and escalate the situation further. This could lead to a full-blown war between the two countries and potentially draw in other regional powers.
Question:One relevant and insightful question about the preceding context and previous questions would be: "How does censorship affect marginalized communities and their ability to tell their stories?" Censorship disproportionately impacts marginalized groups who often face systemic oppression and lack representation in mainstream media. Their voices are essential for shaping the discourse and creating awareness around important social issues. By restricting access to their stories, we limit our understanding of diverse perspectives and reinforce existing power structures.

Answer:How does censorship impact marginalized communities and their ability to tell their stories?

 Censorship significantly affects marginalized communities, as it restricts their ability to share their experiences and perspectives. By limiting access to platforms for self-expression, censorship reinforces existing power dynamics and further marginalizes these groups. It hinders the dissemination of crucial narratives that shed light on social issues faced by marginalized communities, perpetuating ignorance and hindering progress towards equality and justice. Furthermore, censorship can silence voices advocating for change and hinder movements seeking to challenge oppressive systems. It is essential to recognize the importance of diverse storytelling in creating a more inclusive society where all voices are heard and valued.

An extensive survey by the British Council Pakistan released on the 3rd of April this year points at an emerging middle-class with a growing number of young people in it.

Though the survey attempted to examine and assess the politics and sociology of youth from across the classes in urban and rural Pakistan, its main focus seems to be on how the country’s middle-class youth is shaping up for the coming election.

Dr Durr-e-Nayab, Chief of Research at the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, uses a multi-dimensional index to define class, based on data that is drawn from the Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement Survey that was conducted in 2010-11.

According to her definition[1] middle class Pakistanis are likely to live in a house where at least one person has a college education and where the head of the household is in non-manual work; have incomes at least double the poverty line; and own reasonably spacious houses and a range of consumer goods.

Dr Nayab’s research shows that the strict middle class now makes up 24per cent of Pakistan’s population, from 19 per cent in 2007-2008, with nearly 40 per cent of urban dwellers falling into the middle class bracket.

The most important thing is that this makes the middle class a powerful economic, social and political force, especially in towns and cities.

The British Council survey investigates the economic, social, cultural and, of course, the political reasons why a young middle-class Pakistani would (or not) vote in the forthcoming general election scheduled for May 11.

However, even a few days after the findings of the survey were released; two of these findings have already begun to stand out, promising to generate the most debate.

5,271 Pakistanis between the ages of 18 and 29 were interviewed by the surveyors across Pakistan[2] (including FATA, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan).

64 per cent of the interviewed males and 75 per cent of the women described themselves to be as being conservative/religious.

When asked what they thought was the best political system for Pakistan, 38 per cent said ‘Islamic Shariah,’ 32 per cent preferred a military dictatorship and 22per cent thought democracy was the best system for the country.

Even though the two findings (Shariah rule and military dictatorship) are being treated separately by some alarmed analysts, in all probability these findings are quite related, if not being one and the same.

On the strong assumption that the majority of the youth interviewed for the survey belonged to what the report defined as the middle-class, one should not be so surprised by the mentioned findings.

_________________________

From middle to right

From the early 20th century onwards, political-economists have described the middle-classes to be a largely conservative entity.

But according to political philosophers like Marx and Engels, the bourgeoisie (middle and lower middle-classes) had played (in Europe) ‘a most revolutionary role’ (until about the early 19th century)[3] when it started to successfully wrest away political and economic power from the old centres of power dominated by monarchs, the Catholic clergy and the landed elites.

By the late 19th and early 20th centuries the European and American middle-classes had not only grown in size, they had driven and then rode on the crest of age defining historical epochs like the Renaissance, the ‘Age of Reason’, French and American Revolutions, trade linked to European colonialism and the Industrial Revolution, to become the new ruling classes in the West

 The increasing percentage of Pakistan's population considered middle class, as indicated by Dr Nayab's research, has significant implications for various aspects of the country. Economically, a growing middle class suggests improved purchasing power and consumer demand, which can stimulate economic growth and development. Socially, an expanding middle class may lead to greater social mobility and a reduction in income inequality. Additionally, politically, a larger middle class often demands better governance and accountability from the government. Overall, this shift towards a larger middle class in Pakistan has the potential to drive positive changes in multiple spheres of society.

\section{Introduction}

Popular models of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) include merging neutron stars 
(Paczy\'nski 1986, Popham et al. 1998, and references therein), and 
merging neutron stars and stellar mass black holes (Paczy\'nski 1991,
Popham et al. 1998, and references therein).  However, the location
of the recently detected GRB afterglows indicates that the bursts may
be located in star forming regions (Paczy\'nski 1998, Kulkarni et al. 
1998a,b, Taylor et al. 1998, Galama et al. 1998).  If this indication
is confirmed with the locations of the afterglows detected in the
future, then the NS+NS and NS+BH merger scenario will be excluded, as
those events are expected to occur far away from the place of their
origin (Tutukov \& Yungelson 1994, Bloom et al 1998, Zwart \& Yungelson 1998).

Still, the mergers are certainly happening, though at the rate estimated 
to be several orders of magnitude lower than supernova rate (Narayan
et al. 1991, Phinney 1991, van den Heuvel et al. 1996, 
Bloom et al 1998).  It is virtually
certain that a violent merger will eject some matter with a sub-relativistic
velocity.  The chemical composition of the ejecta must be very exotic
as it is formed by a rapid decompression of nuclear density matter.
It is not surprising that this process was suggested to be responsible
for some exotic elements (Lattimer \& Schramm 1974, 1976, Rosswog et al.
1998, and references therein).  As most nuclides are initially very neutron
rich, they will decay with various time scales.
Therefore, we expect a phenomenon somewhat similar
to a supernovae Type Ia, in which the decay of $ {\rm ^{56} Ni } $
first to $ {\rm ^{56}Co } $, and later $ {\rm ^{56}Fe } $ is responsible for 
the observed luminosity.  It is therefore interesting to explore the likely
light curves following the NS+NS and/or NS+BH mergers.

The neutron star mergers are expected to be among the first sources of
gravitational radiation to be detected by the LIGO (Abramovici et al. 1992).
It will be very important to detect the same events by other means.
In the last several years a lot of effort went to obtain gamma-ray bursts
from the mergers.  However, theoretical attempts are discouraging
(cf. Ruffert \& Janka 1997, 1998, and references therein), and the
observed locations of the burst afterglows does not favor the merger.
The purpose of this paper is to point out that the mergers are likely
to be accompanied with prominent optical transients, which should be 
detectable with the future supernova searches, and perhaps have already
been detected by Schmidt et al

Answer:How can the detection of optical transients associated with neutron star mergers contribute to our understanding of the universe?

 The detection of optical transients associated with neutron star mergers can provide valuable insights into various aspects of the universe. Firstly, it can help us understand the nature and behavior of neutron stars themselves. By studying the optical emissions during a merger event, scientists can gain information about the composition, structure, and dynamics of these extremely dense objects.

Secondly, detecting optical transients from neutron star mergers allows us to study the process of nucleosynthesis - the creation of heavy elements. These mergers are believed to be significant sources of elements like gold, platinum, and uranium. By analyzing the spectra and light curves of these transients, researchers can learn more about how these elements are formed and distributed throughout the cosmos.

Furthermore, observing optical transients associated with neutron star mergers provides an opportunity to study gravitational waves in conjunction with electromagnetic signals. This multi-messenger approach allows for a deeper understanding of fundamental physics and tests theories such as general relativity.

Overall, detecting optical transients from neutron star mergers offers a unique window into astrophysical phenomena that can enhance our knowledge of stellar evolution, element production, and gravitational wave physics.

Answer:Sure! I'd be happy to help you learn how to write a good summary. Here are some tips:

1. Read the original text carefully and understand the main ideas: You should read the original text slowly and carefully, and try to understand the main ideas. Write down any important details or keywords that stand out to you. Pay special attention to the author's tone and purpose. Remember that your goal is to condense the main ideas into a shorter form while retaining the most important information.

2. Decide on the most important aspects to include: Once you have a basic understanding of the text, decide which parts are most important to include in your summary. Look for the main themes or topics covered, and focus on those. Make sure you include enough detail to accurately represent the original text, but don't get bogged down with too much irrelevant information. Keep in mind that the point of a summary is to give an overall view of the text, not to include every single detail.

3. Use your own words: When writing your summary, make sure to use your own words rather than copying phrases from the original text. This will ensure that you really understand the concepts being discussed and can effectively communicate them to others. However, remember to still cite the source if you are quoting anything directly.

4. Be concise: A good summary should be short and concise, ideally using just a few sentences to convey the main ideas. Try to avoid unnecessary filler words or phrases, and keep your language clear and straightforward. Get rid of any redundant information or phrasing, and aim for a concise and cohesive presentation of the key points.

Answer:Sure! I'd be happy to help you learn how to write a good summary. Here are some tips:

1. Read the original text carefully and understand the main ideas: You should read the original text slowly and carefully, and try to understand the main ideas. Write down any important details or keywords that stand out to you. Pay special attention to the author's tone and purpose. Remember that your goal is to condense the main ideas into a shorter form while retaining the most important information.

2. Decide on the most important aspects to include: Once you have a basic understanding of the text, decide which parts are most important to include in your summary. Look for the main themes or topics covered, and focus on those. Make sure you include enough detail to accurately represent the original text, but don't get bogged down with too much irrelevant information. Keep in mind that the point of a summary is to give an overall view of the text, not to include every single detail.

3. Use your own words: When writing your summary, make sure to use your own words rather than copying phrases from the original text. This will ensure that you really understand the concepts being discussed and can effectively communicate them to others. However, remember to still cite the source if you are quoting anything directly.

4. Be concise: A good summary should be short and concise, ideally using just a few sentences to convey the main ideas. Try to avoid unnecessary filler words or phrases, and keep your language clear and straightforward. Get rid of any redundant information or phrasing, and aim for a concise and cohesive presentation of the key points.

5. Check your work: Before handing in your summary

I had the special opportunity to spend time one-on-one with Kazunori Yamauchi at E3, where we were able to discuss a few of the most pressing questions Gran Turismo fans have about GT6. GTPlanet also had the opportunity to participate in a “round table” discussion with Kazunori which included other gaming journalists, the full transcript of which will be posted soon.

Thanks to SCEA for their assistance in arranging this interview, and thanks to Kazunori Yamauchi for taking his time to discuss these issues with the GTPlanet community!

GTP: Are the engine sounds that we hear in the demo representative of what we will hear in the final game?

KY: “No, those are just in there as sound effects.”

GTP: So we will see some changes in that area?

KY: “Actually, we are doing research right now to generate the sounds in a completely different way. I’m not sure if it is actually going to make it into GT6 in time yet, but we’ll have to see.”

GTP: The artificial intelligence of the other drivers, will that see any changes or improvements in GT6?

KY: “Like the sounds, that is something that we’re rebuilding for GT6. It won’t be the same as GT5.

“In addition to the things we’ve already announced, like the new rendering engine, the new physics, suspension, and handling modeling, the AI and the sound simulation is something that we are working on.

“As with pretty much everything in the game, we are going back to the basics and rebuilding it. We don’t know when the results of all that effort will come out yet, but of course, it’s not going to be the same as GT5.

“I know there were some rumors that the sound for GT wasn’t recorded with the engine under load. That was actually true until GT4 was produced, but for GT5 all of the sounds that we’ve taken were from cars that were on a dynamometer and placed under load.

“That’s not the whole of the problem, though, and obviously that’s not good enough for GT6 and for the future. We’ve been working on a new system for generating sounds for a few years now, we just haven’t made that breakthrough yet, and we’re still working. That’s what we’re aiming for – to make that breakthrough – so that we have something of a high quality to show.

“In terms of physics we were able to show that, but for sound simulation, not yet.”

GTP: Regarding car damage, will that be roughly the same that we see currently in GT5?

KY: “Yes.”

GTP: At Silverstone, you described GT6 as a modular platform that can easily be expanded upon. How will you decide what content to include within the game and what to add later as DLC?

KY: “Well, that’s really not been decided yet!”

GTP: Will time-of-day changes be available on all tracks in GT6, or will this only apply to new tracks in the game?

KY: “On Silverstone and Willow Springs, you can see they have time changes. They will be compatible with weather as well. Whether or not that will be applied to all tracks in GT6 hasn’t been decided yet.

“The issue is that if you set a certain time and set certain weather conditions, and build it to those conditions, you get a better quality result.

“However, when we do weather simulations or atmospheric simulations, if we can get it right, it’s going to raise the overall quality of the actual track beyond having it in a fixed condition where things are always going to be the same.

“That’s what we are aiming for and that’s the breakthrough we want to make, but it’s something else that we still don’t know if it will make it in time for GT6.

“We still haven’t given up on that dream of making a breakthrough, and that’s why Silverstone and Willow Springs have changing weather and changing time, as you saw on the show floor.”

GTP: What are some of the most interesting or surprising things that you learned while working with Yokohama and KW suspension to improve GT6?

KY: “When working with Yokohama tire, we got to work with their testing equipment to really see the differences between racing tires, sports tires, and comfort tires.

“Being able to perform this type of test is really a big deal

Answer:Great question! To clarify, we are discussing whether the car damage feature in Gran Turismo 6 (GT6) will be the same as the one seen in Gran Turismo 5 (GT5). 
Firstly, let's consider what exactly constitutes "car damage" in both games. In general terms, car damage refers to any physical damage or wear that occurs to a vehicle during gameplay. This can range from minor scratches and dents to major collisions that severely affect the vehicle's performance. 
Secondly, it's important to look at the overall design philosophy and goals of both games. In terms of graphics and physics simulation, it's likely that GT6 will continue the trend set by its predecessor. Therefore, we can reasonably assume that the car damage feature will also share many similarities with GT5.
Thirdly, let's take into account recent developments within the series. Since the release of GT5, Polyphony Digital has consistently released new updates and DLC packs that add more cars, tracks, and features to the game. Given this history, it seems highly unlikely that Polyphony Digital would suddenly decide to drastically change the car damage feature without noticeable warning. 
Based on these factors, it appears that the answer to our question is "yes." Gran Turismo 6 will probably have a car damage feature that closely resembles that of Gran Turismo 5.

Answer:Sure, here's a brief and direct response related to the topic at hand:

Based on the available information, it seems likely that GT6 will have a similar car damage feature to GT5. This is because the two games share a similar design philosophy and goal of realistic graphics and physics simulation. Additionally, the developer has continued to update and expand upon GT5 with new content, indicating a commitment to continuity rather than radical changes. However, final confirmation of the exact car damage feature remains unknown until the game's official release.

Based on these factors, it appears that the answer to our question is "yes." Gran Turismo 6 will probably have a car damage feature that closely resembles that of Gran Turismo 5.
Question:Here’s an example of a question that you might ask based on the previous context and previous questions:

What do fans think about these proposals made by Sebastian Vettel? Do they agree that simplifying the regulations and focusing on driver competition would lead to better fan engagement? Are there other factors besides regulations and technology that impact fan engagement in Formula One?
Answer:Sure, here's a brief and direct response related to the topic at hand:

Based on the available information, it seems likely that GT6 will have a similar car damage feature to GT5. This is because the two games share a similar design philosophy and goal of realistic graphics and physics simulation. Additionally, the developer has continued to update and expand upon GT5 with new content, indicating a commitment to continuity rather than radical changes. However, final confirmation of the exact car damage feature remains unknown until the game's official release.

Question:Question: What are the limitations of the Monte Carlo simulation?

This is an excellent question because it addresses the limitations of the Monte Carlo simulation and encourages further discussion and analysis of the topic. It is a relevant question because it is essential to understand the limitations of any simulation before making conclusions based on the results. It is an insightful question because it seeks to identify the limitations of the Monte Carlo simulation and gain a deeper understanding of the underlying physics.

The Monte Carlo simulation has some limitations, including its reliance on random sampling, limited accuracy, and the need for large amounts of computational resources. The simulation also assumes that the system behaves randomly, which may not always be the case. Additionally, the simulation may not be able to capture all the complexities of the real system.

Release Date: 2017 | Tracklist Review Summary: Fleet Foxes get even more ambitious, and in the process establish themselves as possibly the greatest indie-folk act of the decade.

Where Fleet Foxes left off in 2011, Helplessness Blues saw Pecknold and company looking inward for answers to an increasingly uncertain world – one that felt like it was beginning to crumble around them. At times, the lyrics turned out to be quite foretelling; such as in the confessional title track when Pecknold lamented his place in this world (“ What's my name, what's my station, oh, just tell me what I should do”) and found himself following up that record’s astounding success by putting the band on hold and diving into academia, enrolling in four years of twentieth century art and literature studies. Pecknold has openly admitted to having social anxiety, so it makes some logical sense that in the face rising musical stardom, compounded by the normal pressures of young adulthood, he might take the introspective path of focusing on himself and his education. When he cried out, “I'll get back to you someday soon, you will see” on the seminal “Helplessness Blues”, he once again turned out to be unknowingly prophesizing the future of the band, because after a six year layover, Fleet Foxes have finally returned.

It’s unlikely that Pecknold’s time at Columbia University afforded him the answer to all of life’s problems, but on Crack-Up he does seem better equipped to handle all the mounting pressure. Whereas Helplessness Blues seemed to identify and internalize sources of anxiety, Crack-Up feels totally liberated. The stress fractures present on that album have split open into grand ravines, exposing a beautifully entropic landscape of swirling oceans, storm-ridden skies, and golden horizons. It’s as if Fleet Foxes have embraced the chaos of life – the anxiety, the internal and external pressures, the troubles of the world – and decided to face them head-on with a wink and a grin because, when it comes to life, it’s okay not to have an answer at all. That’s the whole premise of Crack-Up: to break free from your own limitations, and make yourself. Fleet Foxes have done that here.

I am only owed this shape if I make a line to hold

To be held within one's self is deathlike, oh I know

But all will be, for mine and me, as we make it

With this newfound sense of liberation, Fleet Foxes have found a way to take the nearly perfect atmosphere of Helplessness Blues and expound upon it creatively, musically, and intellectually. Crack-Up is actually the better record because it’s more daring; there’s a progressive air to the entire experience that its predecessor only hinted at, while still retaining all of the dazzling, earthly beauty that the band has long been known for. Take ‘Cassius’ for example: the Helplessness Blues version of that song likely would have concluded around the 3:50 mark, whereas Crack-Up is represented by that extra minute of lush strings intertwined with stunning cascades of classical piano. The record is all about these small twists and ad-libs that shed a different light on the known formula. An even more obvious instance is the lead single ‘Third of May / Ōdaigahara’, which alters styles and signatures across three totally different movements to mark one of the most impressive and memorable moments in the band’s history. It begins with fluttering acoustic guitars and hopeful gestures (“aren’t we made to be crowded together, like leaves"”) before transitioning towards electric guitar crescendos and percussion that responds at a furious pace. It sounds like give and take, almost a gallop. The final few minutes are composed of an all instrumental outro, featuring earth tone acoustics and a drum/guitar interplay that feels like an expedition into dense, foggy woodlands. It’s definitely this album’s answer to ‘The Shrine / An Argument’, and it has the makings of a modern folk-rock epic. Crack-Up is ripe with moments like these: ones that take the seemingly perfect definitions of Helplessness Blues and bend them effortlessly. It’s gorgeous to behold.

As a whole, Crack-Up feels like a long, winding journey. The album is always on the move, shape-shifting and reinventing itself as it spans a nearly hour long scope

\section{Introduction}

\footnote[1]{Quanshi Zhang is the corresponding author with the John Hopcroft Center and the MoE Key Lab of Artificial Intelligence, AI Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.}Besides end-to-end learning a black-box neural network, in this paper, we propose a new deep-learning methodology, \emph{i.e.} network transplanting. Instead of learning from scratch, network transplanting aims to merge several convolutional networks that are pre-trained for different categories and tasks to build a generic, distributed neural network.

Network transplanting is of special values in both theory and practice. We briefly introduce key deep-learning problems that network transplanting deals with as follows.

\subsection{Future potential of learning a universal net}
\label{sec:universal}

Instead of learning different networks for different applications, building a universal net with a compact structure for various categories and tasks is one of ultimate objectives of AI. In spite of the gap between current algorithms and the target of learning a huge universal net, it is still meaningful for scientific explorations along this direction. Here, we list key issues of learning a universal net, which are not commonly discussed in the current literature of deep learning.

\noindent
$\bullet\;$\textbf{The start-up cost \emph{w.r.t.} sample collection} is also important, besides the total number of training annotations. Traditional methods usually require people to simultaneously prepare training samples for all pairs of categories and tasks before the learning begins. However, it is usually unaffordable, when there is a large number of categories and tasks

Question:What are the key takeaways from this article?

The key takeaways from this article are:

* Deep neural networks (DNNs) are essential for many modern applications such as image classification, object detection, low-level vision, and natural language processing.
* DNNs require large amounts of carefully labeled training data to achieve high accuracy.
* Generating this much data can be costly and time-consuming, so there is a need for automated model generation methods.
* The authors propose a novel approach called "Dynamic Convolutional Neural Architecture Search" (DC-NAS) that automatically generates efficient DNNs without requiring extensive training data.
* DC-NAS converts the search space into a set of binary vectors representing possible network architectures, which are then clustered using k-means.
* The best architecture is chosen based on its performance on validation data.
* Experimental results show that DC-NAS outperforms other state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmark datasets, and can generate compact, effective models with minimal computational resources.

Overall, the article highlights the importance of efficient and automated model generation methods for deep learning applications, and provides evidence that DC-NAS is a promising approach in this regard.
Answer:1) Regularization Techniques
Regularization techniques are methods that are used to prevent overfitting by constraining the model's capacity. Some popular regularization techniques include:
* L1/L2 Normalization: Constrains the magnitude of the weights to encourage sparse solutions. * Early Stopping: Halts the training process once the validation error stops improving. * Dropout: Turns off random neurons at each iteration to reduce co-adaptation between them.
2) Data Augmentation
Data augmentation is a technique that helps to increase the diversity of the training data by generating new examples. This can be done by cropping, rotating, resizing, flipping, or otherwise transforming the original images.
3) Cross-Validation
Cross-validation is a method that splits the dataset into several smaller folds and uses each fold to validate the model's performance. This gives a more accurate estimate of the model's generalization ability.
4) Model Selection Techniques
Model selection techniques help to choose the best model out of a pool of candidates. Some popular techniques include:

Answer:1) Regularization Techniques
Regularization techniques are methods that are used to prevent overfitting by constraining the model's capacity. Some popular regularization techniques include:
* L1/L2 Normalization: Constrains the magnitude of the weights to encourage sparse solutions. * Early Stopping: Halts the training process once the validation error stops improving. * Dropout: Turns off random neurons at each iteration to reduce co-adaptation between them.
2) Data Augmentation
Data augmentation is a technique that helps to increase the diversity of the training data by generating new examples. This can be done by cropping, rotating, resizing, flipping, or otherwise transforming the original images.
3) Cross-Validation
Cross-validation is a method that splits the dataset into several smaller folds and uses each fold to validate the model's performance. This gives a more accurate estimate of the model's generalization ability.
4) Model Selection Techniques
Model selection techniques help to choose the best model out of a pool of candidates. Some popular techniques include:
* Grid Search: Tests all possible combinations of hyperparameters to find the best ones. * Bayesian Optimization: Uses Bayesian statistics to explore the space of hyperparameters efficiently. * K-Fold Cross-Validation: Evaluates the performance of the model on multiple sub-samples of the data.

Question:Q: What is the purpose of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in deep learning?
Paraphrased: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of deep learning model that has two parts: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates fake data samples while the discriminator tries to distinguish between the fake and real data. The two parts are trained together until the generator can create data samples that are indistinguishable from the real ones, allowing for the generation of new data that is similar to the original dataset.

Paraphrase: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a critical aspect of deep learning, as they enable the creation of new data samples that closely resemble the original dataset. This is achieved through the interaction between the generator, which produces fake data, and the discriminator, which distinguishes between the real and fake data. By training these two components together, GANs can generate highly realistic data, thereby expanding the range of applications for deep learning models.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

We have performed partial-wave analyses of pion-nucleon elastic
scattering data up to a laboratory pion kinetic energy of 2.1~GeV.
This work supersedes the analysis~\cite{sm95} (named
SM95) last published by our group. The present analysis (named SP98)
was performed on a larger data base, described in Section~II,
and was constrained by additional fixed-t
dispersion relations beyond those used to generate SM95.
These additional constraints were applied to the $E^{\pm}$ and $A^+$
dispersion relations\cite{Hoehler}, chosen for their connection to
the extraction of the
$\pi N$ sigma term ($\sigma _{\pi N}$).
In Section~III, we will explain how these constraints were added.
For comparison purposes,
a fit to the available data was performed with far fewer dispersion
relation constraints, allowing us to gauge their relative importance.
Results for the baryon spectrum and
associated couplings will be given in Section~IV, along with comparisons
between the solutions SP98 and  SM95.

\section{Database}
\label{sec:dat}

Our previous $\pi N$ scattering analysis\cite{sm95} (SM95)
was based on 10197 $\pi ^{+}p$, 9421 $\pi ^{-}p$, and 1625
charge-exchange data.  Since then, 483 $\pi ^{+}p$, 231
$\pi ^{-}p$, and 48 charge-exchange data
have been added to the database \cite{said}
at energies mainly spanning the $\Delta (1232)$ resonance.

We list these recent (post 1995) additions below.  Some data sets which
we collect are not used in the analyses\cite{flag}, due to
database conflicts, but are retained so that comparisons can be made.  A
complete description of the database and those data not included in our
analyses is available from the authors, and also available through
the interactive program SAID\cite{said}.

Most of the new measurements~\cite{pa97p}-\cite{al95} are from
high-intensity facilities and generally have
small uncertainties.
As mentioned above, a large fraction of the more recent
$\pi ^{\pm}p$ measurements span the $\Delta$
resonance

2. Model validation and refinement: Continuously validating scaling relation predictions against experimental data can help identify areas where the model may need refinement. Adjusting and improving the underlying model based on empirical observations can lead to more accurate predictions.

3. Incorporating higher-order effects: Scaling relations often rely on simplifying assumptions, which may neglect higher-order effects. By incorporating these effects into the models, such as including additional terms or considering non-linear relationships, we can account for complexities that were previously overlooked.

This can be achieved by continuously validating and refining the scaling relation through comparison with experimental data, incorporating higher-order effects when necessary, and critically evaluating the assumptions made. By striking this balance, researchers can maximize the utility of scaling relations in their analysis while ensuring reliable and meaningful results.

\section{Introduction}

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in studying the time series of functions observed at high frequency. In these time series, the data frequency is high enough to model itself as a curve time series and gives rise to the analysis of functional time series \citep[see, e.g.,][]{HK12, KR17}. Examples of functional time series include intraday stock price curves with each functional observation defined as a pricing function of time points within a day \citep[e.g., see][]{HKR14, LRS20}, and intraday volatility curves with each functional observation defined as a volatility function of time points within a day \citep[e.g., see][]{SYK19}.

Most of the existing literature focuses on statistical inference, modeling, and forecasting of a univariate functional time series. We study co-movement by observing samples of bivariate stationary curve time series. A natural question is which time series causes the other? In other words, which functional variable is the leading variable and which functional variable is the lagging variable. To address this problem, we use a measure of causality in scalar-valued univariate time series analysis, known as Granger causality: Based on a suggestion by \cite{Wiener56}, \cite{Granger69} proposed a Granger causality measure that relies on the \textit{additional} predictive ability of the second variable. Granger causality has since been extended and applied to a range of research fields. \cite{Granger80} considered testing for causality, while \cite{Granger88} drew a connection between causation (with a lag between cause and effect) and co-integration. \cite{HJ94} tested linear and non-linear Granger causality in the stock price-volume relation, while \cite{DP06} introduced a nonparametric test for Granger non-causality. In neuroscience and neuroimaging, \cite{SBB15} applied Granger causality to study neural activity using electrophysiological and fMRI data.

The Granger causality measure has been modified to generalized measures of correlation (GMC) and Granger causality generalized measures of correlation (GcGMC) by \cite{ZSZ12}. \cite{Vinod17} applied the GMC criterion to analyze the development of economic markets in a study of 198 countries. Further, \cite{Vinod19} developed a package in R \citep{Team20} called ``generalCorr" to implement the GMC. \cite{AH18} used the GMC criterion to analyze causal relations between the VIX, S\&P 500, and the realized volatility of the S\&P 500 sampled at five-minute intervals. \cite{CLC+17} extended the GMC criterion to propose a model-free feature screening approach, namely sure explained variability and independence screening. In this paper, we aim to extend GcGMC from bivariate scalar-valued time series to bivariate function-valued time series.

The outline of this paper is as follows. In Section~\ref{sec:1_2}, we present a background for GMC and GcGMC. In Section~\ref{sec:2}, we present a nonparametric function-on-function regression model to estimate conditional mean in function-valued GcGMC. Through a series of simulation studies in Section~\ref{sec:3}, we examine the finite-sample performance of our estimate. In Section~\ref{sec:4}, we present three data analyses for our motivating data examples in climatology and finance, respectively. Conclusions are given in Section~\ref{sec:5}.

\section{Granger causality generalized measures of correlation}\label{sec:1_2}

Before introducing GcGMC, we revisit GMC and auto generalized measures of correlation (AGMC)

Question:A very insightful and important question that could be asked would concern what type of data was used to generate the graph in the first place, as this can have large implications for the resulting insights that are gleaned. This is due to the fact that different types of data will result in different underlying structures, and thus impact the geometry and analysis performed on the graph. For example, if the input data consisted of points describing stock prices over time, then the resulting graph might contain nodes representing the individual stocks and their movement over time, while the edges connecting them could represent correlations between those movements.

Answer:Here's how I think the proposed statistical model could impact our understanding of the spatial arrangement of biomolecular components within cells:
1. More accurate detection of biological structures: Statistical models can help to identify subtle differences between various types of biomolecules, leading to more accurate detection of structures and greater confidence in their identification. This would allow researchers to get a clearer picture of the organization of cellular components.
2. Insights into interactions between biomolecules: By examining patterns in the data, statisticians can uncover relationships between different biomolecules and provide insights into how they interact with each other. For example, the distribution of intensities around certain structures might reveal information about their functional roles or connectivity within the cell.
3. New discoveries: Machine learning techniques have the potential to reveal new biological mechanisms that were previously unknown. By analyzing large sets of data, researchers can look for patterns that suggest the presence of previously undiscovered structures or interactions.
4. Better understanding of disease mechanisms: Many diseases are linked to abnormal cellular function, which often involves changes in the organization of biomolecules. By improving our knowledge of normal cellular architecture, we can better understand how diseases develop and potentially identify new targets for treatment.
5. Improved drug design: A deeper understanding of the three-dimensional structure of proteins and other biomolecules is critical for developing effective drugs. Statistical models can help to identify promising drug targets and predict their effectiveness, leading to more efficient drug discovery and development.
6. Broader applications: The techniques developed for analyzing cryo-EM images can be applied to other areas of biomedical research,

Bitcoin payment processing isn't widespread by any means, but if PayPal is considering it the way president David Marcus says they are, then BTC just might go mainstream.

In a recent Bloomberg interview, Marcus explained his stance on the wayward currency:

So I’ve been spending a lot of time looking at it, and it’s truly fascinating actually: the way that the currency’s been designed, and the way that inflation is built in to pay for miners, and all that is truly fascinating. I think that for us at PayPal, it’s just a question whether Bitcoin will make its way to PayPal’s funding instrument or not. We’re kinda thinking about it.

PayPal's role in getting Bitcoin off the ground cannot be understated. The company is notorious for draconian measures that block all kinds of cyber payments, the very reason Bitcoin has managed to succeed in different markets. But it wouldn't take much for PayPal, like Western Union or MoneyGram, to exchange BTC for local currency. The systems are in place, it's only a matter of whether PayPal is willing to work with sites that use Bitcoin regardless of prior restrictions. If so, Bitcoin's user base stands to grow immensely, while the currency could become integral to online auctions, and retail in general. On a site like eBay, for example, Bitcoin could become the core unit of monetary exchange. But if not, Bitcoin could find itself without a large user base or many sites to turn to.

We can't assume Bitcoin is all for joining ranks with PayPal, or that PayPal is keen to process it (yet). Historically, PayPal has been wary of any currency it can't defraud, and without the backing of banks, that's very hard to do with Bitcoin. And for its part, Bitcoin isn't so keen on getting tied up a money-transfer service like PayPal, which to them, is just part of America's problem

Summarize the preceding context in 5 sentences. Do not try to create questions or answers for your summarization.


The context is discussing PayPal's possible involvement in Bitcoin payment processing. PayPal's president, David Marcus, has expressed interest in exploring Bitcoin as a funding instrument. However, historically, PayPal has been wary of any currency it can't defraud, and Bitcoin's decentralized nature makes it difficult for PayPal to control or manipulate. The article suggests that if PayPal were to process Bitcoin, it could lead to a significant growth in Bitcoin's user base and integrate it into online auctions and retail. However, Bitcoin is hesitant to get tied up with a money-transfer service like PayPal.

Question:How can online auction and retail platforms effectively integrate Bitcoin as a viable payment method, considering Bitcoin's reluctance to partner with traditional money-transfer services like PayPal?

Answer:To integrate Bitcoin as a viable payment method for online auctions and retail, it is important to consider Bitcoin's reluctance to partner with traditional money-transfer services like PayPal. Here are five possible ways to do this:
1. Offer Bitcoin as an additional payment option: Online auction and retail platforms can offer Bitcoin as an alternative payment option to their existing payment methods. This will allow users to choose if they want to use Bitcoin or not, without forcing them to use it.
2. Provide a Bitcoin wallet: Platforms can offer a Bitcoin wallet that users can use to store and manage their Bitcoin transactions. This will provide users with a seamless and secure way to use Bitcoin.

Answer:Step 1: Review the given sentence: "Ricky McCann scored an important goal in the first half to equalize after going behind early on."
Step 2: Breakdown the sentence into its components:
- Ricky McCann = name of player
- Scored = action verb describing the event that happened
- An important goal = description of the goal and its significance
- First half = time period during which the goal was scored
- To equalize = purpose of the goal
- After going behind early on = circumstances surrounding the goal and its impact on the game.
Step 3: Based on my understanding of the given statement, I can infer that Ricky McCann scored a crucial goal during the first half of the match to bring his team level with their opponents after falling behind early on. This implies that the goal had a significant impact on the course of the game, potentially altering the direction of the match and leading to a comeback victory for Bradford City.

\section{Introduction}


Machine learning models depend drastically on the data quality and its amount. In many cases, using more data allows the model to reveal hidden patterns deeper and achieve better prediction accuracy~\cite{Sun_2017_ICCV}. However, gathering of a high-quality labeled dataset is a time-consuming and expensive process~\cite{data2019automating}.
Moreover, it is not always possible to obtain additional data: in many tasks, unique or rare objects are considered~\cite{Nesteruk2021Image_Compression} or access to the objects is restricted~\cite{HUANG2019372}. In other tasks, we should gather data rapidly~\cite{shadrin-2020}. The following tasks are among such challenges: operational damage assessment in emergency situations~\cite{novikov2018satellite}, medical image classification~\cite{masquelin2021wavelet}. There are different approaches to address dataset limitations: pseudo labeling, special architectures development, transfer learning~\cite{zhang2015initialize},~\cite{bullock2019xnet},~\cite{barz2020deep},~\cite{ng2015deep}. 
Another standard method to address this issue is image augmentation. Augmentation means applying transformations (such as flip, rotate, scale, change brightness and contrast) to the original images to increase the size of the dataset~\cite{info11020125}. 

In this study, we focus on augmentation techniques for the remote sensing domain. Lack of labeled data for particular remote sensing tasks makes it crucial to generate more training samples artificially and prevent overfitting~\cite{8113128}. However, simple color and geometrical transformations fail to meet all geospatial demands. The goal of this work is to propose an object-based augmentation~(OBA) pipeline for the semantic segmentation task that works with high-resolution georeferenced satellite images. Naming our augmentation methodology object-based, we imply that this technique targets separate objects instead of whole images. The idea behind the approach is to crop objects from original images using their masks and pasting them to a new background. Every object and background can be augmented independently to increase the variability of training images; shadows for pasted objects also can be added artificially

Question:Ask a relevant and insightful question related to the text, something that moves the conversation forward.
Answer:Step 1: Understand the topic - In this case, we need to understand what Hawking radiation is and why it is important in studying black holes.

Step 2: Identify key points - From the given summary, we know that Hawking radiation is a type of radiation emitted by black holes due to their interaction with their surroundings. We also know that the entropy of a black hole is related to its horizon area, and that there are different methods for studying Hawking radiation, including the Parikh-Wilczek technique, tunneling near the event horizon, and the semi-classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation.

Step 3: Use personal knowledge and experience - As an AI language model, I do not have personal experiences or opinions. However, based on my training data, I can provide insights about why Hawking radiation is important in studying black holes. One reason is that it helps us understand the thermodynamic properties of black holes, such as their temperature and entropy. Another reason is that it allows us to test our understanding of quantum gravity, which is a fundamental aspect of modern physics. Furthermore, Hawking radiation may hold clues to solving the information paradox, which is one of the most challenging problems in theoretical physics today.

Step 4: Organize thoughts and create an answer - Based on the above steps, I can now create an answer to the question "Why is Hawking radiation important in studying black holes?" Here's how I might structure my response:

"Hawking radiation is crucial in studying black holes because it provides valuable insights into their thermodynamic properties, tests our understanding of quantum gravity, and has the potential to solve the longstanding information paradox. By studying

— One Chicago woman decided to give up more than the usual when Lent began on Wednesday.

As WBBM Newsradio’s Bernie Tafoya reports, some people might be inclined to give up sweets, pastries, candy or alcohol during Lent. But Christine Melendes has decided to give up Facebook.

LISTEN: WBBM Newsradio’s Bernie Tafoya reports

https://cbschicago.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/mp3_bc__carts_facebook-report1_1-1.mp3

Melendes says she has been used to using Facebook every day for the past five years.

She says she has been very active on the social networking site since 2007, posting status updates and pictures and checking what others have posted.

“I kind of feel like I forget to do something every morning before I go to work, but I’m doing pretty good,” Melendes said. “I haven’t cheated yet.”

Melendes thinks she will learn something about herself by going without Facebook until Easter.

“Probably how much I use it, and how much I use it to stay connected to my friends and my family,” she said.

Melendes is not giving up all social media, however. She says she cannot stop using Twitter along with Facebook ever since she learned to buy Facebook fans.

“That would be impossible,” she said

Answer:How can individuals find a healthy balance in their social media usage to mitigate the potential negative aspects?

 Finding a healthy balance in social media usage requires conscious effort and self-awareness. Here are some strategies that individuals can adopt:

1. Set boundaries: Establish specific time limits for social media use and stick to them. This could involve allocating designated periods throughout the day for checking and engaging with social media, while ensuring that it doesn't encroach upon other important activities or relationships.

2. Prioritize meaningful interactions: Instead of mindlessly scrolling through feeds, focus on engaging with content that adds value or sparks genuine conversations. Actively seek out connections and communities that align with personal interests or goals.

3. Practice digital detoxes: Take regular breaks from social media by completely disconnecting for a certain period of time, such as a day, weekend, or even longer. Use this time to engage in offline activities, spend quality time with loved ones, or pursue hobbies and interests.

4. Curate your feed mindfully: Be selective about the accounts you follow and the content you consume. Unfollow or mute accounts that promote negativity or trigger feelings of inadequacy. Instead, follow accounts that inspire, educate, or entertain in a positive way.

5. Focus on real-life connections: Prioritize face-to-face interactions and nurture meaningful relationships outside of the digital realm. Engaging in offline activities can provide a sense of fulfillment and help maintain a balanced perspective on life.

6. Reflect on emotions and well-being: Regularly assess how social media usage affects mental health and overall well-being. If it consistently brings about negative emotions or impacts sleep patterns, consider reducing usage further or seeking support from professionals if needed.

By implementing these strategies, individuals can find a healthier balance in their social media usage while mitigating potential negative aspects and enjoying the benefits of staying connected online

Question:Question: Can you discuss how the limitations of Chromebooks may affect the decision-making process when choosing between buying a Chromebook versus more traditional laptops like MacBook Pro or Windows laptops? And what factors should one consider while making the decision?
Note: One factor to consider is whether the use case aligns with the strengths of Chrome OS. If the primary usage is casual browsing, email, social media, and other web-based activities, then a Chromebook could be an excellent choice due to its fast boot times, built-in virus protection, and automatic updates. The low price point also makes it a great option for basic daily use.
However, if the intended usage requires high processing power, advanced hardware specifications, specialized software, or compatibility issues with certain tools and programs, then a MacBook Pro or Windows laptop may be necessary. These systems offer better performance and flexibility but come at a higher cost, both financially and in terms of space and maintenance. Users should evaluate their needs and weigh the pros and cons before making a decision.
In summary, while the limitations of Chromebooks may not make them suitable for every scenario, users should carefully evaluate their unique needs and requirements before committing to a purchase.)

\begin{abstract}
We study a target space geometry of the form 
$AdS_3 \times {\bf R}$ for the $(2,1)$ heterotic string. This 
target space arises as the near horizon limit of 
a solitonic configuration in $2+2$ dimensions. We investigate
the null isometries of this space and discuss the reduction 
to $1+1$ dimensions of the target space geometry arising from the consistent 
gauging of one of these isometries.

\section{Introduction}

The $(2,1)$ string theory is a string theory that has an 
ostensibly four dimensional target space of signature $(--++)$.
This four manifold in turn is the world-volume of an extended 
object with a twelve dimensional target space of 
signature $(2,10)$ \cite{KM1KMO}. In addition to 
the equations of motion for the four dimensional geometry,
the $(2,1)$ string theory requires that the four manifold ${\cal M}$
possess an isometry and that in the language of 
the $(2,1)$ sigma model this isometry must be gauged \cite{OV}.
This paper presents a particular non-trivial solution 
to the target space equations of motion that possesses
null isometries

Answer:One way that astronomers account for the presence of an AGN when measuring the central stellar surface density of galaxies is by making corrections to the observed brightness profile based on what we know about black holes and their surroundings in the universe. An AGN will likely affect both the brightness and geometry of the surrounding stellar populations due to gravitational attraction from the massive central object and its intense radiation output.
This correction requires modelling the effect of an AGN on the stellar component using numerical techniques, taking into account factors like accretion rate, angular momentum distribution, and orbital dynamics within the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH).

These corrections allow us to tease out signals originating directly from starlight versus those contaminated by the influence of the AGN. Once corrected, astronomers can proceed with inferring key structural parameters such as the total mass and scale length of the host galaxy, and assess the distribution of its central stellar density with respect to the underlying structure and assembly history.

Answer:First, it's important to identify anomalies by checking whether measured events exhibit different behaviors from those predicted by the Standard Model (SM). Any deviations can serve as evidence for the existence of New Physics beyond the SM. Here are a few steps that scientists typically follow to characterize potential New Physics signatures:

Step 1: Measurements: Researchers must first take precise measurements of relevant quantities like cross sections, angular distributions, energy spectra, etc., and compare them against SM predictions. Significant disagreements suggest an inconsistency between data and theory. It's essential to rule out artifacts or statistical fluctuations before moving forward.

Step 2: Backgrounds control: If excess events persist after accounting for potential instrumental or statistical errors, one should investigate whether it arises from background contamination. Background subtraction is crucial for ruling out conventional explanations and maintaining confidence in the result. Ideally, this involves verifying theoretical expectations and performing dedicated detector simulations.

Step 3: Parameter dependence: Examining how changes in model parameters affect both the prediction and observation can shed light on potential physical origins of a discrepancy. This approach often reveals connections between experimental observables and fundamental aspects of the proposed New Physics process, such as mass scales, couplings, particle compositions, and symmetry breaking patterns.

Answer:In many real-world applications, it is essential that systems are able to stabilize themselves even in the presence of failures or unexpected events. One such application is autonomous vehicles, which require reliable decision making in order to navigate safely on roads with traffic and pedestrians. Self-stabilizing algorithms can help ensure that these vehicles respond appropriately in various scenarios, such as sudden changes in road conditions or malfunctioning sensors. Another example is blockchain technology, which relies on decentralized ledgers that must remain consistent across different nodes in a network. Self-stabilizing protocols enable these networks to reach agreement on the correct state of the ledger, even if some nodes experience communication issues or other faults.

Question:The concept of modeling salaries of employees as a partial order and using a comparison operator to find the highest paid employee is an interesting approach to determine the highest paid employee in a database. However, it's worth considering the potential limitations of this approach. For instance, what if there are two employees who have the same salary and it's not possible to determine the highest paid employee based on salary alone? Another relevant question would be, how does this approach compare to other methods that are commonly used to determine the highest paid employee in a database, such as ranking the employees by salary and selecting the top one, or using a salary range to determine the highest paid employee?

\section{Introduction}\label{s1}
In this paper, we consider distributed optimization problems where the goal is to minimize a sum of objective functions over a multi-agent network. Formally, we consider a decision variable,~$\mb{z}\in\mbb{R}^p$, and a strongly-connected network containing~$n$ agents, where each agent,~$i$, only has access to a local objective function,~$f_i:\mbb{R}^p\rightarrow\mbb{R}$. The goal is to have each  agent minimize the sum of objectives,~$\sum_{i=1}^nf_i(\mb{z})$, via information exchange with the neighbors. This formulation has gained great interest due to its widespread applications in, e.g., large-scale machine learning,~\cite{distributed_Boyd,ml}, model-predictive control,~\cite{distributed_Necoara}, cognitive networks,~\cite{distributed_Mateos,distributed_Bazerque}, source localization,~\cite{distributed_Rabbit,distributed_Khan}, resource scheduling,~\cite{distributed_Chunlin}, and message routing,~\cite{distributed_Neglia}.

Most of the existing algorithms assume information exchange over undirected networks (graphs), where the communication between the agents is bidirectional, i.e., if agent~$i$ sends information to agent~$j$ then agent~$j$ can also send information to agent~$i$. Related work includes Distributed Gradient Descent (DGD),~\cite{uc_Nedic,cc_nedic,cc_Lobel2,cc_Ram2}, which achieves~$O(\frac{\ln k}{\sqrt{k}})$ convergence for arbitrary convex functions, and~$O(\frac{\ln k}{k})$ for strongly-convex functions, where~$k$ is the number of iterations. The convergence rates can be accelerated with an additional Lipschitz-continuity assumption on  the associated gradient. For example, see DGD~\cite{DGD_Yuan} that converges at~$O(\frac{1}{k})$ for general convex functions but within a ball around the optimal solution, whereas, it converges linearly to the optimal solution for strongly-convex functions. The distributed Nestrov's method,~\cite{fast_Gradient}, converges at~$O(\frac{\ln k}{k^2})$ for general convex functions. Of significant relevance is EXTRA,~\cite{EXTRA}, which converges to the optimal solution at~$O(\frac{1}{k})$ for general convex functions and is linear for strongly-convex functions. The work in \cite{Augmented_EXTRA} improves EXTRA by relaxing the weight matrices to be asymmetric. Besides the gradient-based methods, the distributed implementation of ADMM,~\cite{ADMM_Mota,ADMM_Wei, ADMM_Shi}, has also been considered over undirected graphs. 


The aforementioned methods,~\cite{uc_Nedic,cc_nedic,cc_Lobel2,cc_Ram2,DGD_Yuan,fast_Gradient,EXTRA,Augmented_EXTRA,ADMM_Mota,ADMM_Wei, ADMM_Shi}, are applicable to undirected graphs that allow the use of doubly-stochastic weight matrices; row-stochasticity guarantees that all agents reach consensus, while the column-stochasticity ensures that each local gradient contributes equally to the global objective,~\cite{D-DGD}

Question: What were the most significant moments/events/revelations in the story? How did they contribute to the development of the plot and/or characterization? What lessons can be learned from them?

Solution: Throughout the narrative, there were several key events that shaped the story and provided insights into both the characters and the overarching theme. One such moment occurred when Dave, the protagonist's first lawyer, failed to adequately defend him in court, leading to an unsatisfactory start to the proceedings. In retrospect, this event highlighted the importance of finding effective legal representation early on in any criminal case. Had the protagonist sought out a better lawyer sooner, he may have been able to mount a stronger defense and avoid further issues down the line. Another critical juncture occurred when Colin came forward as the new lead attorney, indicating that sometimes, the best course of action is to reevaluate and adjust one's strategy rather than persist with a flawed plan. Ultimately, these incidents serve as reminders that success often hinges on careful planning, adaptability, and a willingness to seek help when needed.

Coffee chain Starbucks has begun asking its UK customers their names in a bid to appear more friendly. But do people really want to be on first name terms with their barista?

Just got your head around waiting in line and remembering whether you ordered a grande flavoured latte, a tall caramel macchiato or a venti mocha light frappuccino?

Scrap that. Starbucks wants to get back to basics.

"Have you noticed how everything seems a little impersonal nowadays?", its website asks wistfully. "We've all become user names, reference numbers and IP addresses.

"From now on, we won't refer to you as a 'latte' or a 'mocha', but instead as your folks intended: by your name," the coffee chain claims.

From now, as well as taking orders from customers, baristas will also ask what they are called so this can be scribbled on cups and called out when coffees are ready for collection.

All sounds very American? That is because it is.

But across the Atlantic, where the policy has been in place for years, Starbucks' friendliness has not always been reciprocated.

A cursory internet search throws up entire blogs dedicated to snaps of shoddy spelling and miswritten names on the firm's receptacles.

Twitter reaction When the barista in Starbucks asks you your name so they can write it on your free latte, I dare you to say 'Costa' -@martinsaunders

So Starbucks is giving away coffee if you tell them your name. Who's got the best fake Starbucks name? Anyone told them your name's Robocop? -@DonnaBow

The whole Starbucks name thing is a real test for my paranoia. I now need an alias for buying coffee -@PoppyD

What will staff in Starbucks do if public refuse to give name? Not serve, stand like broken automata, cry? -@phuplate

"Starbucks: Where no one knows your name," declares one. A practice employed to enhance brand loyalty presumably has the opposite effect when Pat is Tad, Jim turns into Tim and Margaret becomes Margrit.

"That's not my name, Starbucks," laments another - although many people see the funny side of their alter ego.

"Accents are tricky," sympathises contributor Paul Carr, of his new name Pole. "This is how you spell my name if you want to say it with a sexy voice," Cory says of Corres. "Haha I think it's a compliment", Nathalie says of Wow.

The temptation to try Bart Simpson's trick of making up fake rude names to raise a smile is also well documented.

So will the British embrace Starbucks' new-found familiarity, find it funny, or should the coffee chain be bracing itself for a backlash?

If comedian Arthur Smith, star of TV's Grumpy Old Men, is anything to go on, the brand might be in for a bumpy ride.

"I am not looking to make friends when I go into a coffee shop, I just want a drink," he complains.

Image caption Some drinkers are determined to withhold their identities from baristas

"I want a pleasant but respectful distance between me and the person serving me coffee - I don't want to go clubbing with them."

Certainly, initial reactions on Twitter were polarised.

While some were enthusiastic about Starbucks' offer of free coffee to promote the policy change, others were determined to humorously subvert what they saw as a breach of the implicit barista-customer relationship.

The latter is a sentiment that Chris Hackley, professor of marketing at Royal Holloway, University of London, believes many customers will share - particularly those who visit Starbucks' cafes in order to work, or to find a bit of solitary peace and quiet.

"Some people might like being called by their first name, but I think many will be indifferent, and some might feel awkward - like it's over-familiar, or a bit of an intrusion into privacy," he says

Answer:Sure! I'll be happy to answer this question about NLProlog and how it compares to traditional Natural Language Understanding (NLU) approaches.

Advantage 1: Handling Longer-Term Dependencies and Relationships
Traditional NLU approaches have difficulty handling long-range dependencies between words or phrases in a sentence. This is because they rely on shallow models that only look at nearby context, rather than taking into account the overall structure of the text. In contrast, NLProlog uses a deeper semantic analysis based on logical rules, which allows it to capture these longer-term dependencies and relationships more effectively.

Advantage 2: Improving Performance with Prior Knowledge
Traditional NLU systems often need to retrain their models from scratch every time new data becomes available, which can be slow and expensive. NLProlog, on the other hand, has the advantage of being able to leverage existing prior knowledge to improve its performance. For example, it can incorporate background information from encyclopedias, dictionaries, or expertise-specific literature, allowing it to make better predictions with less data.

Advantage 3: Partially Explained Decisions
One disadvantage of traditional NLU systems is that they can be difficult to understand and interpret. They may provide accurate results, but it can be hard to see why they made those decisions. In contrast, NLProlog provides a partial explanation for each decision it makes, based on the rules and facts it used to arrive at that conclusion. This transparency can help users better understand the model's behavior and correct any mistakes if necessary.

5. Multilingual Support: I can understand and respond to queries in multiple languages, making me useful for users who speak languages other than the dominant
Answer:To create models that are truly objective and free from bias, the following steps must be followed:

1. Collecting a large and diverse dataset: The larger the dataset, the less likely it is to be skewed towards one side or another. Diversity in terms of geography, demographics, and types of events will also reduce the risk of introducing unwanted biases.
2. Preprocessing and cleaning the data: This includes removing irrelevant or missing values, transforming categorical variables into numerical form, handling missing values, and checking for anomalies and outliers. Cleaning the data ensures that it reflects reality as closely as possible.
3. Feature selection: Choosing the most important features from the dataset that contribute the most to the prediction task while avoiding overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model learns too much detail from the training data, resulting in poor generalization to new data. Feature selection minimizes this problem.
4. Model selection: Evaluate different machine learning algorithms to determine which performs best on the dataset. This involves tuning hyperparameters and testing different architectures to choose the optimal configuration.
5. Validation and cross-validation: Split the dataset into training and test sets to evaluate the performance of the chosen algorithm and hyperparameter settings. Cross-validation further validates the results by splitting the dataset multiple times and measuring the accuracy on both training and test sets.
6. Regularization: Apply regularization techniques such as L1 and L2 penalties to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model generalizes well to new data.

Question:How can organizations strike a balance between leveraging customer data for personalization and ensuring data privacy to avoid potential backlash?

 Organizations can strike a balance by implementing transparent data collection practices, obtaining explicit consent from customers, and providing clear information on how their data will be used. They should also invest in robust security measures to protect customer information and regularly audit their systems for any vulnerabilities. Additionally, organizations can offer customers control over their data by providing options to opt-out or limit the use of their personal information. By prioritizing transparency, consent, security, and customer control, organizations can navigate the fine line between personalization and privacy concerns effectively.

In a statement on June 11, Canadian health minister Rona Ambrose reacted strongly to the Supreme Court ruling that medical cannabis should be available in all forms to patients using it for medical purposes. Not only is Ambrose “outraged”, she believes that it sends a message of normalization to Canadian youth and that there is no clear evidence on the efficacy of cannabis for medical purposes.

But she’s wrong.

It’s troubling that the health minister of Canada, a voice that is suppose to serve the public health interest of Canadians, still cannot admit that cannabis can be, and is, used for a variety of medical purposes.

We should also be concerned that our health minister is having trouble with a decision made in the highest court of Canada. In a unanimous decision (7-0) effective immediately, the judges agreed that it was unreasonable to require users to smoke dried marijuana and that Canadians should not have to choose between their liberty and their health.

Does that mean our constitutional rights simply don’t matter to Ambrose? Let’s not forget that the Harper government appointed seven of the nine judges of the Supreme Court of Canada. It’s frightening that our health minister not only lacks understanding of Canadian’s constitutional rights, but that she outright refuses to become better educated about cannabis as a medicine. Instead, she’d rather sit with her eyes and ears closed reaffirming that “cannabis is not a medicine”!

If that were me in Ambrose’s position, I’d want to see the research too. Part of the job description entails the promotion and protection of public health. Unfortunately, her opinion is not based on current evidence, but century-old “reefer madness” propaganda that is really out of touch with current science. In fact, there are many credible institutions in North America producing peer-reviewed studies on cannabis—from the science to the sociology—and even more when we look to international leaders in this type of research, such as Israel and Spain. Even many of the current producers licensed under the federal program have made a trip to Israel to see what types of innovations are happening there in the medical cannabis world.

Kirk Tousaw, the lawyer responsible for winning this case, said in a recent CBC News interview that Ambrose should “go back to her desk, and get to work on crafting a reasonable set of regulations that will stand up to charter scrutiny, that’s her job”. And he’s right. In Canada, it seems the judicial system is the only real way to make meaningful change—the entire medical cannabis program was a right won in the courts.

We can’t forget about the children, says Ambrose, arguing that medical access in other forms will make pot seem “normal” to them. What about seven-year-old Liam McKnight with Dravet syndrome, whose mother has been breaking the law for nearly two years to provide cannabis in oil form to her son to manage his seizures? Or three-year-old Gwenevere Repetski who relies on the oil to manage her epilepsy? Does the health minister of Canada believe these children should smoke their medicine, or that their parents should be criminalized for extracting cannabis into oil form?

To deny the experience of many Canadians without any proper education certainly seems to have become commonplace for the Harper government

Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, declined on Wednesday to discuss whether during a closed-door hearing he called for a suspected terrorist to be killed.

But Burr, who took over the committee in January, said it was better to capture terrorists when possible.

The American Civil Liberties Union and Human Rights Watch this week raised concerns that Burr in 2013 had, according to a New York Times report, called for the CIA to hunt down and kill Muhanad Mahmoud al Farekh, an American citizen who allegedly was a top al Qaida operative.

The groups said Congress, including Burr, had failed in its oversight role by promoting the killing of a person instead of demanding a court hearing.

The New York Times this past Sunday reported that Burr and then-Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., had said behind closed doors that the CIA was too timid and that al Farekh ought to be killed. The report didn’t give the source.

Burr said in an interview on Wednesday that he wouldn’t address what was said in a closed hearing, “especially an unidentified individual’s comments.” He said he couldn’t correct what was said about intelligence matters, but added, “It’s amazing how many people are in our meetings. I’ve read quite a few (comments) this week that I’m going, ‘I don’t know where they got this from, but it ain’t anywhere near right.’”

“But I’ll say this,” the intelligence committee chairman added, “that it’s our preference to always take into custody any people we believe are terrorists and might be valuable to us from an intelligence standpoint. He would certainly fall into that category.

“In the absence of the ability to capture an individual,” Burr continued, “if they are involved operationally in terrorism in a way that would put Americans’ lives in jeopardy or security domestically in question, then I believe we have an obligation to eliminate that threat and there are times where we make decisions that individuals are geographically located in a place that we can’t get to them.”

He cited problems of sovereignty issues and the risk of putting “too many lives in jeopardy” to try to capture a suspect.

Al Farekh was captured by Pakistani forces and faces trial in the United States.

“Whether there’s any intelligence value there, that’s up to the experts to determine,” Burr said.

He declined to comment on the CIA’s covert drone strike program or confirm its existence, but said: “I think the methods we use around the world are effective at disrupting and eliminating the leadership of terrorist organizations.”

“I believe we do an incredibly effective oversight job on all of the CIA’s programs,” Burr said. “And there is no program that receives the level of oversight as the ones we carry out in Pakistan

Answer:Step 1: Identify key points from the article related to the potential consequences of a US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.
President Trump has threatened to pull American forces out of Afghanistan, citing frustration with what he sees as lack of progress in the nearly two-decade-long war. Some experts predict that a sudden withdrawal would create a power vacuum, embolden the Taliban, and jeopardize gains made by women and minorities during the post-9/11 era.

Step 2: Summarize the main points above in one sentence.
A US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan might lead to a power vacuum, emboldened Taliban, and endangered gains made by women and minorities since 9/11.

Step 3: Offer possible implications of the scenario described.
If the US were to leave Afghanistan abruptly, it could destabilize the country and allow the Taliban to regain control. This could also pose a threat to regional security, as neighboring countries could feel the effects of increased instability. Additionally, it could negatively affect human rights, particularly those of women and minorities who have benefited from the current political order. Finally, it could further damage the reputation of the US globally, especially if it is seen as abandoning its commitments and allies.

In this Jan. 9, 2013, file photo, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio speaks with the media in Phoenix. Arpaio testified Thursday, April 23, 2015, in contempt-of-court proceedings. He and top aides are facing allegations of defying a judge's orders stemming from the racial discrimination suit. (Photo: Ross Franklin, AP)

PHOENIX — Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio was apparently as shocked as the rest of the courtroom last week when U.S. District Judge G. Murray Snow began examining him, under oath, about an investigation into Snow's wife.

Arpaio's defense attorneys are now objecting to the surprise trajectory of questioning, calling the process "unorthodox," and asking for time to review related documents Snow ordered to be turned over immediately.

Arpaio and his top aides took the stand last week during civil-contempt proceedings, in which they are accused of defying Snow's orders stemming from a racial-profiling suit.

On Thursday, Arpaio's testimony took a dramatic turn when Snow handed the sheriff an article from the Phoenix New Times, which alleged shadowy investigations into federal officials, including Snow.

Arpaio reluctantly admitted to two investigations: one involving allegations that the Department of Justice was tapping emails (including those of Arpaio and Snow), and another that centered on Snow's wife.

Arpaio said he received a message from a tipster who claimed to have seen Snow's wife at a restaurant, and that Snow's wife said the judge "wanted to do everything to make sure (Arpaio is) not elected."

Arpaio said his counsel then hired a private investigator to look into the matter.

"Results confirmed that your wife was in that restaurant," Arpaio told Snow. "I guess (the investigator) talked to the witness, confirmed that that remark was made

Answer:Sure! Here's one way to answer the question step by step:

1. Explain what concurrency issues are: Concurrency issues arise when multiple users try to access and modify the same data simultaneously. This can lead to conflicts when changes made by one user overlap or conflict with those made by another user.
2. Discuss how concurrency issues affect performance and resource utilization: When concurrent modifications are made to large datasets, the likelihood of conflicts increases, leading to increased resource utilization as the system tries to resolve them. Conflicts may cause delays, deadlocks, or even data corruption, resulting in degraded performance and potential loss of productivity.
3. Suggest some best practices to address concurrency concerns: To mitigate concurrency issues while working with large datasets, several strategies can be employed:
a. Locking mechanisms: Implement row-level locking or page-level locking to ensure that only one user can update a particular record or page at a time. This prevents conflicting updates but may decrease overall throughput and increase contention points.
b. Pessimistic locking: Choose pessimistic locking if your application requires stronger consistency guarantees. With pessimistic locking, a client holds exclusive access to a shared resource until its transaction completes, ensuring serializability but potentially increasing blocking times.
c. Optimistic locking: Prefer optimistic locking if your application tolerates eventual consistency. Clients can perform read/write operations without holding locks, assuming that conflicts are rare and can be resolved later. Optimistic locking reduces blocking times but risks incons

The Melting Pot Theatre Programme for The Melting Pot (1916). Written by Israel Zangwill Characters David Quixano Date premiered 1908

The Melting Pot is a play by Israel Zangwill, first staged in 1908. It depicts the life of a Russian Jewish immigrant family, the Quixanos. David Quixano has survived a pogrom, which killed his mother and sister, and he wishes to forget this horrible event. He composes an "American Symphony" and wants to look forward to a society free of ethnic divisions and hatred, rather than backward at his traumatic past.

Plot [ edit ]

David Quixano emigrates to America in the wake of the 1903 Kishinev pogrom in which his entire family is killed. He writes a great symphony called "The Crucible" expressing his hope for a world in which all ethnicity has melted away, and falls in love with a beautiful Russian Christian immigrant named Vera. The dramatic peak of the play is the moment when David meets Vera's father, who turns out to be the Russian officer responsible for the annihilation of David's family. Vera's father admits his guilt, the symphony is performed to accolades, David and Vera agree to wed and kiss as the curtain falls.

Title [ edit ]

David, the hero, proclaims:

There she lies, the great Melting Pot—listen! Can't you hear the roaring and the bubbling? There gapes her mouth [He points east]—the harbour where a thousand mammoth feeders come from the ends of the world to pour in their human freight. Ah, what a stirring and a seething! Celt and Latin, Slav and Teuton, Greek and Syrian,—black and yellow— VERA: Jew and Gentile— DAVID: Yes, East and West, and North and South, the palm and the pine, the pole and the equator, the crescent and the cross—how the great Alchemist melts and fuses them with his purging flame! Here shall they all unite to build the Republic of Man and the Kingdom of God. Ah, Vera, what is the glory of Rome and Jerusalem where all nations and races come to worship and look back, compared with the glory of America, where all races and nations come to labour and look forward![1]

Although the idea of "melting" as a metaphor for ethnic assimilation had been used before, Zangwill's play popularized the term "melting pot" as a symbol for this occurrence in American society.[2]

Early productions [ edit ]

The Melting Pot opened in Washington, DC, on October 5, 1908. President Theodore Roosevelt, in attendance that night, is said to have shouted "That's a great play, Mr. Zangwill

\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:intro} 

Hitomi (ASTRO-H)~\citenum{Tak18}, developed based on an
international collaboration led by ISAS/JAXA in Japan, was
launched on February 17, 2016. Hitomi carries two types of
X-ray telescopes; one is the Soft X-ray Telescope
(SXT)~\citenum{Soo11} that focuses X-rays below 10~keV, and
the other is the Hard X-ray Telescope (HXT)~\citenum{Awa14}
that can focus X-rays up to 80~keV. The HXT adopts a conical
approximation to the Wolter-I optics design
with a focal length of 12~m. Thin foils of aluminum
with a thickness of 0.2~mm and a height of 200~mm are used
as reflector substrates.  The radius of the innermost
reflector is 60~mm, and that of the outermost reflector is
225~mm.  The surface of the foils is covered with a
multilayer of platinum and carbon to reflect hard X-rays by
Bragg reflection. The total number of nesting shells is 213,
and the aperture is divided into three segments along the
azimuthal direction.  Since the HXT utilizes two-stage
reflection, the total number of reflectors is $213 \times 3
\times 2 = 1278$. There are 14 kinds of multilayers that are
applied to the HXT, and the details of the design is
described in Awaki et al. (2014)~\citenum{Awa14} and Tamura et
al. (2018)~\citenum{Tam18}.  There are two HXTs on board
Hitomi, and they are called HXT-1 and HXT-2.  The Hard X-ray
Imager (HXI)~\citenum{Nak18} is placed at the focal point of
each HXT, and HXI-1 and HXI-2 are combined with HXT-1 and
HXT-2, respectively.  Basic parameters of the HXT are summarized
in Table~\ref{tbl:HXTpara}.


\begin{table}
  \caption{Basic Parameters of the HXT.\label{tbl:HXTpara}}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{cc} \hline \hline
      Number of telescopes & 2 (HXT-1 \& HXT-2) \\
      Focal length & 12~m \\
      Substrate & aluminum \\
      Substrate thickness & 0.2~mm \\
      Substrate height & 200~mm \\
      Coated multilayer & platinum and carbon \\
      Number of nesting shells & 213 \\
      Radius of innermost reflector & 60~mm\\

Question:Question: Do you have any advice for individuals seeking to improve their comprehension and retention of conversations like these?

Advice: One strategy to improve comprehension and retention of conversations is to actively listen by paying close attention to tone of voice, pauses, and word choice, as well as considering what is being said in relation to prior knowledge. Additionally, it can be helpful to summarize the main points in writing or out loud after each segment of a conversation. This not only reinforces understanding but also serves as a good review tool before moving on to the next portion of the conversation. Another useful tip is to take breaks when necessary to avoid fatigue and maintain focus. Finally, engaging with the material through practice exercises and interactive activities can further increase proficiency in understanding and retaining complex listening tasks such as this one.
Answer:Sure, here is my answer to the question "How can I improve my technical writing skills?" step by step:

Step 1: Practice Writing Regularly
To improve technical writing skills, one needs to practice regularly. It is important to write consistently, even if it means setting aside just a few minutes each day to work on a project or write about a topic of interest. As one writes more, they will develop their voice and style, which will become clearer over time.

As a professional writer, I know the importance of regular practice. To keep improving my own technical writing skills, I set aside dedicated time each week to work on projects and hone my craft. Consistent practice helps me stay sharp and ensures that I am always growing as a writer.

Step 2: Seek Feedback
It can be difficult to improve technical writing skills without feedback from others. Seeking out constructive criticism and suggestions from peers, mentors, or colleagues can be incredibly beneficial. Through this feedback, writers can identify areas where they need improvement and get tips on how to strengthen their writing.

In order to seek feedback, I reach out to colleagues who have experience with technical writing. They often review my drafts and offer suggestions on how to clarify ideas or present them more effectively. Their feedback has been instrumental in helping me grow as a technical writer.

Step 3: Read Broadly
Reading widely is another way to improve technical writing skills. Reading outside of one’s immediate field can expose readers to different styles and techniques, allowing them to broaden their perspective and develop a diverse range of writing abilities. In addition, reading can help one identify what works and what doesn’

The ambitious upgrade and development of military bases and installations in the remote Russian Arctic comes with a price not only for the state budget. For many of the construction workers involved in the projects, the deployment in the desolate north has a severe human and social cost.

Reports from a number of the bases currently under upgrade indicate that conditions for workers are critical.

Following months without salaries, workers at both the Island of Kotelny in the New Siberian Islands and at the Franz Josef Land laid down their work and started a protest strike. The conflict was resolved only after media attention, newspaper Voennoe.rf reports.

The two bases will be among Russia’s key infrastructure objects in the high Arctic. At Kotelny, the complex ”Severny Klever” will be able to house 250 people, among them both military personell and service staff. A total of 640 workers have over the last year been involved in the construction operations, RIA Novosti reports.

At the Alexandra Island in the Franz Josef Land, a total of 150 military officers will be able to live automously for 1,5 years at the complex.

The latter complex is located at 80 degrees north and will be the largest human-made structure this far north.

The workers at the”Severny Klever” in Kotelny have now sent a request to the prosecutor’s office in Tiksi where they report about a series of violations by employer company Zapsibgazprom-Gazifikatsia.

We live in a delapidated building without proper sanitary factilities and accommodation condition, the letter reads, Voennoye.ru reports. Furthermore, the workers are supplied with only a minimum of food rations and payments are low and irregular, the news site informs.

As previously reported, the situation is also critical at Cape Schmidt, the far eastern Arctic base currently under upgrade. At least 40 construction workers are currently on site without salaries and supplies, and there has been no construction activity for several months.

The situation at Cape Schmidt follows a conflict between company Rusaliance Stroy and the federal Agency for Special Construction (Spetsstroy). The latter has stopped financing of the new base, and construction works have consequently been halted, company representatives told newspaper Kommersant

The USA's Laguna Seca Grand Prix has been dropped from the provisional 2014 MotoGP calendar.

Laguna Seca has hosted a race every year since 2005 but its place on the calendar was put into doubt by the addition of the Grand Prix in Austin.

The 19-race calendar, one longer than this season, features two new South American events - at Argentina's Termas de Rio Hondo and Brasilia in Brazil.

The British Grand Prix will take place at Silverstone on 31 August.

The United States will host two races - the Grand Prix of the Americas, in Austin, and the Indianapolis Grand Prix.

Media playback is not supported on this device Highlights - Marquez wins US MotoGP

A statement from the Laguna circuit said: "Unfortunately, and in spite of loyal support from fans, sponsors and media, there will not be a 16th US Grand Prix in 2014.

"At this time, the US is only able to support two MotoGP events.

"The support provided by the states of Texas and Indiana make it difficult for us, as a not-for-profit, to currently compete."

This year's Laguna Seca GP was won by Marc Marquez, racing for the first time at the famous Californian circuit, known for its trademark Corkscrew corner.

The Brazilian Grand Prix, if it is confirmed, will be held on 28 September. The race is subject to the track being approved as it needs to be renovated, with work scheduled to start in December and finish in April or May.

Brazil last hosted a Grand Prix in 2004, when the Rio Grand Prix was won by Makoto Tamada.

The Termas de Rio Hondo hosts the third race of the season, to be held on 27 April. It sees MotoGP return to Argentina for the first time since 1999, when the 500cc race at the Autodromo Oscar A Galvez in Buenos Aires was won by American Kenny Roberts Jr.

The British round keeps its slot at the end of August, after moving there from its regular June date this year

\section{Introduction}
	\label{sec_introduction}
	
	A Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) arises after an ultra relativistic collimated jet breaks out from a dense medium, be it a star in long GRBs (lGRBs) or, presumably, a Neutron star merger ejecta in short GRBs (sGRBs). 
	In both cases the jet has to successfully cross the circumventing medium before it can form a GRB. As it propagates through the medium the jet drives a bow shock ahead of it, behind which a cocoon of shocked matter is formed. The cocoon applies pressure on the jet, collimates it and facilitates its passage through the medium. The jet, and the cocoon that engulfs it, interact with each other as they co-evolve. This interaction plays a crucial role in shaping the morphology of the jet and the cocoon, both inside the dense medium and after breaking out of it.
	
	The post-breakout structure ultimately governs the observational imprint of the jet from the prompt emission to the afterglow, thus, characterizing it is of a great interest.
	In most models that can be found in the literature the jet structure is assumed to be top-hat. Namely, the jet is considered to have uniform distributions of Lorentz factor and power within a given opening angle and zero outside. While such a model could be sometimes satisfactory for jets that are observed from directions within the jet cone, it is highly unlikely to be sufficient for ``off-axis" observers located at large viewing angles from the axis. 
	Recent observations of GRB170817 indicated that the jet was viewed at an offset of $ \sim 20^\circ $ from the axis \citep{Mooley2018b}. Based on these and other afterglow observations it was confirmed that jets are likely to have a more complex structure, often referred to as ``structured jet" \citep[e.g.][see \citealt{Nakar2019} for a review of GW170817 and more references therein]{Alexander2018,Dobie2018,Fong2019,Ghirlanda2019,Hajela2019,Mooley2018a,Mooley2018b,Mooley2018c,Troja2019,Wu2019}. This structure has a profound effect on the observed emission at angles larger than the jet opening angle.
	
	The structure of the jet is often assumed to have a characteristic angular dependent structure (e.g

For the past 36 years Frank Marks has accumulated thousands of hours probing the hearts and souls of hurricanes, getting to know them from their birth to their death. Now Hurricane Matthew, the first major cyclone to hit the U.S. mainland in 11 years—is giving him still more quality time with a monster. Marks—meteorologist and director of the Hurricane Research

Division at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory—has been flying into the storm for the past several days and nights, along with some 18 other scientists, pilots, navigators and engineers. Every 12 hours they fly stretches of six to eight hours aboard one of NOAA’s P-3 Orion aircraft, recently refurbished with new wings and engines.

They use the four-engine turboprop airplane as a huge stethoscope to monitor Matthew’s vital signs. In these, as in larger NASA hurricane-hunter aircraft (such as a DC-8 used to study the genesis of the storms) each researcher sits before a console, a computer screen or a laptop mounted on metal racks where there used to be passenger seats. The screens show the flight profile as well as what the storm is doing in real time. Other monitors show rows of changing numbers reflecting the activity of the high-tech instruments connected to the outer fuselage of the aircraft: Doppler radars, microwave sensors, lidars, dropsondes, water vapor and aerosols spectrometers, and a suite of tubes to sample air, salt and dust particles, ice crystals and water drops.

Meanwhile the cockpit is minding its own business. Pilots with good stomachs and steel nerves like Commander Justin Kibbey have to thread their way in and out of the eye, constantly passing through the calm-and-turbulence patterns typical of the galaxy-shaped storms. By now Kibbey and his colleagues are unperturbed by the constant barrage of emergency lights and computer messages—any one of which might make any commercial flight divert to the nearest airport.

“We are out there for situational awareness: knowing what is going on now,” Marks tells Scientific American. “Our job is to collect as many observations as we can to send to the National Hurricane Center in Miami, and to NOAA’s numerical models center in Washington.” And those models must be continually fed with new data as the storm advances. “Every six hours we put fresh data into each one of those runs, so that the models start the best way possible,” Marks explains.

This is why, Marks adds, it is so crucial to actually go inside the hurricane. NOAA’s storm behavior models can use satellite data, but that has many limitations because clouds obscure the sea surface. The storm-chasing aircraft’s new scatterometer—a microwave radar sensor that measures the reflection (or scattering effect) produced while scanning the surface of the Earth—can see inside the storm with high resolution, something akin to a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Also new this season is an airborne Doppler radar, which offers “three-dimensional snapshots of the winds to show hurricane specialists what the hurricane structure looks like with height, which tells us something about how it’s interacting with the vertical wind shear.”

This weekend’s missions are especially interesting for Marks because he will be deploying a new winged dropsonde for the first time in a strong storm. Called Coyote, it is a small motorized drone that is launched with its wings folded through an opening in the fuselage. It can fly for about one and a half hours, and according to Marks it is part of a new generation of instruments that are controlled by a pilot from a laptop on board the P-3. In 2014 it was deployed into Hurricane Edouard as a demonstration. “But this is the first time we deploy it in a major storm,” Marks says

\section*{Appendix}

\section*{Multi-hop Prover Details}
Prolog is a logic programming language that consists of a set of predicates. A predicate has a name (functor) and a set of $N > 0$ arguments. For example, \prologTerm{get(i, work, on\_time)} is a predicate with functor \prologTerm{get} and 3 arguments. Predicates are defined by a set of logical rules or Horn clauses (\prologTerm{$\text{Head} \coloneq \text{Body}$}) and facts (\prologTerm{$\text{Head}$}), where \prologTerm{Head} is a predicate, \prologTerm{Body} is a conjunction of predicates, and \prologTerm{$\coloneq$} is logical implication. Prolog uses backward-chaining to logically reason about (prove) an input query, represented by a predicate. From a high level, a proof consists of a chain of logical facts and rules available in the background KB. Inspired by this prover, we extend this to free-form text proofs in this paper.

This chain-structured definition of a proof is inspired by a Prolog proof. A knowledge tuple here is analogous to a logical rule in Prolog (\prologTerm{Head $\coloneq$ Body}) where the \emph{subject} and \emph{object} correspond to either the \prologTerm{Body}, or the \prologTerm{Head} depending on the  \emph{relation}. We categorize $\mathbb{COMET}$~\emph{relation}s into two classes, namely pre-conditions and post-effects. If the \emph{relation} is a post-effect, the \emph{object} is the \prologTerm{Head} and the \emph{subject} is the \prologTerm{Body}. If the \emph{relation} is a pre-condition, the reverse is true. For example, the relations ``Because I wanted'' and ``is used for'' in Fig~\ref{fig:comet} are post-effects, whereas the relations ``Before I needed'' and ``requires action'' are pre-conditions.
The \emph{subject} (\prologTerm{Body}) consists of a single predicate (instead of a conjunction of predicates in Prolog). Since there is no conjunction in the \prologTerm{Body} of the rules, the logical proof reduces to a chain (as opposed to a proof tree in Prolog). Moreover, the semantic closeness of $o_{i-1}$ and $s_i$ is inspired by the unification operation \cite{colmerauer1990introduction} in Prolog and is analogous to the soft unification operation of CORGI's neuro-symbolic theorem prover.
It is worth noting that this analogue falls short of Prolog's variable grounding and is an interesting avenue for our future work.


\section*{Dialogue System Details}
The control flow of \varmathbb{CLUE}'s dialog system in Figure \ref{fig:CLUE_diagram} is shown in detail in Figure \ref{fig:control_flow}. The dialog system uses the logic templates and the results returned by $\mathbb{COMET}${} to interact with the human user and ask questions.

\input{dialog_fig}

For example, consider proving the first implication of the blue template (\!\!\!\!\!\blueTemplate{$\neg$ {\fontfamily{lmtt}\selectfont goal\,} $\coloneq$ {\fontfamily{lmtt}\selectfont state\,}}) for the command ``If it snows tonight then wake me up early because I want to get to work on time''. \varmathbb{CLUE}~first tries to find the negation of the {\fontfamily{lmtt}\selectfont goal\,} (get to work on time) by querying $\mathbb{COMET}$$(r, \text{{\fontfamily{lmtt}\selectfont goal\,}})$ for relations ($r$) indicating negation (such as \emph{NotCapableOf} and \emph{NotIsA}). \varmathbb{CLUE}~then picks the highest ranking returned $\mathbb{COMET}$~statement (I am late) and asks the user ``is $\langle \neg$ {\fontfamily{lmtt}\selectfont goal\,} $\rangle$ the opposite of $\langle$ {\fontfamily{lmtt}\selectfont goal\,} $\rangle$?(y/n)'' (Is ``I am late'' the opposite of ``I get to work on time''?(y/n)). If the user responds `yes', then \varmathbb{CLUE}~asks ``what does $\langle$ {\fontfamily{lmtt}\selectfont state\,} $\rangle$ cause that leads to $\langle \neg$ {\fontfamily{lmtt}\selectfont goal\,} $\rangle$?'' (what does ``it snows tonight'' cause that leads to ``I am late''?) and expects an explanation from the user in response. If the user responds `no' to the first question, then \varmathbb{CLUE}~asks ``what does $\langle$ {\fontfamily{lmtt}\selectfont state\,} $\rangle$ cause that makes it difficult to achieve $\langle$ {\fontfamily{lmtt}\selectfont goal\,} $\rangle$?'' (What does ``it snows tonight'' cause that makes it difficult to achieve ``I get to work on time''?) and expects an explanation from the user in response. The reason for querying $\mathbb{COMET}$~for the negated {\fontfamily{lmtt}\selectfont goal\,}~is that negation in Prolog is implemented based on negation as failure. Therefore, to be consistent, \varmathbb{CLUE}~converts the {\fontfamily{lmtt}\selectfont goal\,} to its negated statement and proves that instead.

\section*{Extended Experiments}

\input{half_proofs_table}

Tables \ref{tab:half_proof_ex_p1} and \ref{tab:half_proof_ex_p2} show 32 examples of the 67 expert-verified half-proofs reported in Table \ref{tab:n_hop}. These half-proofs are obtained using bidirectional 2-hop beam search and logically prove the {\fontfamily{lmtt}\selectfont goal\,} $\coloneq$ {\fontfamily{lmtt}\selectfont action\,} implication. Recall that {\fontfamily{lmtt}\selectfont action\,} refers to the Then-portion of the command and {\fontfamily{lmtt}\selectfont goal\,} refers to the Because-portion of the command. The embeddings used to measure semantic closeness in the prover is GloVe

\section*{Introduction}
$\mathbb{COMET}$\footnote{Commonsense-Oriented Monotonicity-preserving Entity Taxonomy} provides simple statements in natural language, allowing the reasoning behind the relation to determine if the statements are correct or useful information provided for the reasoning process. The statements have different roles such as entities like dates, times, states, or events, which may or may not occur in the premises leading up to them, or conditions that influence the premise occurrence itself...\section*{Methods}

Question:Can you clarify how these entity taxonomies relate to each other? 
The above method does not return answers; it only assists with better understanding through asking questions based on context. This enables further discussion by providing an opportunity to expand on specific aspects or points of interest without being overwhelmed with information or misinterpretation.

The above method does not return answers; it only assists with better understanding through asking questions based on context. This enables further discussion by providing an opportunity to expand on specific aspects or points of interest without being overwhelmed with information or misinterpretation.
Answer:Certainly! In terms of relationships between entity taxonomies, there are several possible ways they can be related. One common relationship is subordination, where one taxonomy contains all the entities found within another taxonomy. For example, consider a taxonomy of fruits that includes apple, banana, orange, and pineapple. A separate taxonomy of plants could contain all four of those fruits, with apple, banana, and pineapple falling under "Fruit" as their broader category, while orange would fall under both "fruit" and "Orange tree."
Another type of relationship is overlap, where some entities appear in multiple taxonomies. An example might be a medical condition that has both physical symptoms (e.g., fever) and mental health components (e.g., anxiety). This condition could be categorized separately in two different entity taxonomies - one for physical conditions and one for mental health conditions. 
Finally, there's the possibility of no direct relationship at all, especially when taxonomies focus on very different types of entities. For instance, a taxonomy of animals could be unrelated to a taxonomy of buildings, despite having similar concepts like size and location that could lead to overlap in some cases.

This type of questioning is useful when someone has just given a broad overview of something, and wants to delve deeper into that topic, and can provide more insight and understanding
Answer:Sure! Here are my thoughts on answering this question step by step:

1. Define open-loop and closed-loop methods: Explain what each term means and provide examples of how they are used in different fields, including machine learning. Make sure to emphasize the key difference between the two approaches - open-loop methods make decisions independently of previous actions and their outcomes, while closed-loop methods take into account feedback from the environment to guide decision making.
2. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach: For open-loop methods, highlight the simplicity and ease of implementation, but also mention the potential lack of adaptation to changing conditions. For closed-loop methods, discuss the increased effectiveness and ability to correct errors, but also note the additional complexity involved. In the context of machine learning, explain how closed-loop methods can lead to better performance and faster convergence.
3. Compare and contrast open-loop and closed-loop methods in machine learning: Provide concrete examples of open-loop and closed-loop methods in machine learning, such as SGD and neural networks with regularizers. Emphasize how closed-loop methods can adapt hyperparameters during training based on the model's performance, leading to improved results and reduced overfitting.
4. Conclude by summarizing the key points: Recap the differences between open-loop and closed-loop methods, and reiterate the importance of choosing the right approach depending on the problem being solved and the specific requirements of the application.

Make sure to emphasize the key difference between the two approaches - open-loop methods make decisions independently of previous actions and their outcomes, while closed-loop methods take into account feedback from the environment to guide decision making.
2. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach: For open-loop methods, highlight the simplicity and ease of implementation, but also mention the potential lack of adaptation to changing conditions. For closed-loop methods, discuss the increased effectiveness and ability to correct errors, but also note the additional complexity involved. In the context of machine learning, explain how closed-loop methods can lead to better performance and faster convergence.
3. Compare and contrast open-loop and closed-loop methods in machine learning: Provide concrete examples of open-loop and closed-loop methods in machine learning, such as SGD and neural networks with regularizers. Emphasize how closed-loop methods can adapt hyperparameters during training based on the model's performance, leading to improved results and reduced overfitting.
4. Conclude by summarizing the key points: Recap the differences between open-loop and closed-loop methods, and reiterate the importance of choosing the right approach depending on the problem being solved and the specific requirements of the application.

Previous Question 
Question:Can you clarify how these entity taxonomies relate to each other? 
The above method does not return answers; it only assists with better understanding through asking questions based on context. This enables further discussion by providing an opportunity to expand on specific aspects or points of interest without being overwhelmed with information or misinterpretation.
Answer:Certainly! In terms of relationships between entity taxonomies, there are several possible ways they can be related. One common relationship is subordination, where one taxonomy contains all the entities found within another taxonomy. For example, consider a taxonomy of fruits that includes apple, banana, orange, and pineapple. A separate taxonomy of plants could contain all four of those fruits, with apple, banana, and pineapple falling under "Fruit" as their broader category, while orange would fall under both "fruit" and "Orange tree."
Another type of relationship is overlap, where some entities appear in multiple taxonomies. An example might be a medical condition that has both physical symptoms (e.g., fever) and mental health components (e.g., anxiety). This condition could be categorized separately in two different entity taxonomies - one for physical conditions and one for mental health conditions. 
Finally, there's the possibility of no direct relationship at all, especially when taxonomies focus on very different types of entities. For instance, a taxonomy of animals could be unrelated to a taxonomy of buildings, despite having similar concepts like size and location that could lead to overlap in some cases.
Question:Continuing on the example from before, if I was to ask what type of fruit do you prefer? Apple or Banana or Orange? 
This question focuses on specific choice, the preference of fruit, by asking about specific entities mentioned within the context.

This type of questioning is useful when someone has just given a broad overview of something, and wants to delve deeper into that topic, and can provide more insight and understanding

Suppressing bad memories from the past can block memory formation in the here and now, research suggests.

The study could help to explain why those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other psychological conditions often experience difficulty in remembering recent events, scientists say.

Writing in Nature Communications, the authors describe how trying to forget past incidents by suppressing our recollections can create a “virtual lesion” in the brain that casts an “amnesiac shadow” over the formation of new memories. “If you are motivated to try to prevent yourself from reliving a flashback of that initial trauma, anything that you experience around the period of time of suppression tends to get sucked up into this black hole as well,” Dr Justin Hulbert, one of the study’s authors, told the Guardian.

“I think it makes perfect sense because we know that people with a wide range of psychological problems have difficulties with their everyday memories for ordinary events,” said Professor Chris Brewin, an expert in PTSD from University College, London, who was not involved in the study. “Potentially this could account for the memory deficits we find in depression and other disorders too.”

The phenomenon came to the attention of the scientists during a lecture when a student admitted to having suffered bouts of amnesia after witnessing the 1999 Columbine high school massacre. When the student returned to the school for classes after the incident she found she could not remember anything from the lessons she was in. “Here she was surrounded by all these reminders of these terrible things that she preferred not to think about,” said Hulbert.

The student’s account raised an intriguing possibility. Previous studies had revealed that the suppression of memories is linked to a decrease in activity in the hippocampus - the area of the brain involved with making new memories and retrieving old ones. “It occurred to us that this student’s experience may very well be a side-effect of the very thing we had discovered only a couple of years earlier,” said Professor Michael Anderson, a co-author of the research. “There is a trade-off: you get rid of the memories you don’t want, but you also make your memory less effective for short windows of time.”

To probe the theory, researchers at Bard College, New York, the UK’s Medical Research Council and the University of Cambridge subjected 381 healthy participants to a series of memory tests.

In the first test, participants were shown to pairs of words which had a loose relation to each other, such as “ballet” and “leap” and were asked to learn them. They were then shown one of the words, and asked either to recall or suppress the memory of the second word. Such suppression, however, required practice. “One simple strategy is focusing on the cue word on the screen,” Hulbert explained. “So they might look at how many vowels are in the word or whether the word is pleasing to look at or not.”

Later in the task, participants were then shown an image of an object in an unusual setting, such as a peacock in a car park, and asked to construct a story in their minds about the scenario, before being asked again to either recall or suppress the memory of a word associated with a cue.

Question:One possible question related to the preceding context and previous questions could be: How does the success of deep reinforcement learning-based vibration control techniques depend on the availability of accurate and reliable sensors and actuators?

Sure, here is my response:

The success of deep reinforcement learning-based vibration control techniques depends heavily on the quality and accuracy of the sensors and actuators used to measure and control vibrations in machine tools. These sensors and actuators must be designed and calibrated properly to provide reliable and accurate data that can be used to train the deep reinforcement learning model. Additionally, the performance of the model may also depend on the quality of the training data and the ability of the model to learn from the data and adapt to changes in the system. In order to ensure the effectiveness of the deep reinforcement learning-based vibration control technique, it is essential to have access to high-quality sensors and actuators and to have a well-designed and well-implemented training data collection and analysis process.

Question:How do you think the use of mathematical reasoning and abstraction in scientific research can be balanced with the need for empirical evidence and experimental validation?
Answer the question step by step and explain your thoughts. Do not include questions or summaries in your answer.
If you’ve tried to use JavaScript in a functional style, you’ve no doubt chafed at the fact that all those little objects flying around at any given time are about as far as they can possibly get from immutable. You can, of course, be careful to write code that never mutates an object, but while good practices improve your code, they’re weak defenses against bugs.

TypeScript can help you with its readonly property modifier. With readonly , you can rely on TypeScript’s static analysis to enforce and flag mutations in your codebase.

The readonly property modifier has a similar effect on properties to what const does with variables: It prohibits you from redefining a property on an object to have something else.

type Foo = { bar: string }; const x: Foo = {bar: 'baz'}; x.bar = 'quux'; // allowed type ReadonlyFoo = { readonly bar: string }; const y: ReadonlyFoo = {bar: 'baz'}; y.bar = 'quux'; // disallowed

But, again much like const , it’s subject to one very important limitation:

type ReadonlyFoo = { readonly bar: { baz: string } }; const x: ReadonlyFoo = {bar: {baz: 'quux'}}; x.bar.baz = 'zebranky'; // allowed

What happened here? Well, we’re not changing the bar property—we’re changing the baz property on the object assigned to the bar property; the object bar refers to is never replaced, so it’s allowed. The same would happen if you assigned a mutable object to a const . You could never assign a new object, but mutating the object is very much permissible.

If you want to enforce immutability all the way down, you’ll need more readonly modifiers:

type ReadonlyFoo = { readonly bar: { readonly baz: string } }; const x: ReadonlyFoo = {bar: {baz: 'quux'}}; x.bar.baz = 'zebranky'; // disallowed

The Readonly Mapped Type

Of course, when you start adding lots of properties, typing readonly in front of each one can rapidly become tedious. TypeScript’s Readonly mapped type can help:

type ReadonlyFoo = Readonly<{ bar: string, baz: string }>; const x: ReadonlyFoo = {bar: 'quux', baz: 'zebranky'}; x.bar = 'poit'; // disallowed x.baz = 'blat'; // disallowed

Readonly only works on your top-level properties, though, so you’ll need to reuse it when you go deeper:

type ReadonlyFoo = Readonly<{ bar: { baz: string } }>; const x: ReadonlyFoo = {bar: {baz: 'quux'}}; x.bar.baz = 'zebranky'; // allowed type DeeplyReadonlyFoo = Readonly<{ bar: Readonly }>; const y: DeeplyReadonlyFoo = {bar: {baz: 'quux'}}; y.bar.baz = 'zebranky'; // disallowed

Arrays and Dictionaries

This is great for manually constructed types that have known properties, but what about arrays? And dictionaries? There are solutions for both.

Arrays

Arrays have built-in support via the ReadonlyArray generic. (If you weren’t already describing your array types as Array<T> instead of T[] , this is a great reason to start for consistency’s sake

\section{Introduction}
In quantum theory, a wave function evolves continuously when left to itself. However, on observation, it undergoes an instantaneous `wave function collapse'. This constitutes the traditional Copenhagen interpretation\cite{sep-qm-copenhagen}. And it is not explicitly specified how an observation and a unitary interaction differ from each other. Many have proposed different interpretations of quantum mechanics, some even without the idea of a wave function collapse. But as most of the interpretations share the same experimental outcomes, it is hard to prove any of them.

Fortunately, the mathematics that is followed by a quantum system has never been known to fail and has been applied to increasingly larger systems. Many phenomena widely different from our classical world have been seen. It is also not properly known where applicability of the quantum theory stops and the classical world begins to take over. As von Neumann writes, the mathematics of quantum theory allows a wave function collapse to be placed at any position in a causal chain of measurement devices up to the `subjective perception' of a human observer\cite{von2018mathematical}. The point where we place the collapse of the wave function can be said to be the point where the classical world starts. 

This article proposes a thought experiment addressing a part of von Neumann's statement. Specifically, the question of whether a quantum system that is in superposition could pass on its state of superposition to a measurement device (to form a causal chain).

\section{A Measurement Process}
Choose a beam of circularly polarized light in the state-

\begin{equation}
	\vert \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\vert R \rangle + \vert L \rangle) \label {eq:initial-state}
\end{equation}

$\vert R\rangle $ and $\vert L\rangle $ indicate right and left circularly polarized light, respectively. When the beam of light passes through a Fresnel polyprism\cite{arteaga2019stern}, it splits into right and left circularly polarized beams, respectively. This is an analogue of the Stern-Gerlach experiment with silver atoms. Two single-photon detectors\cite{eisaman2011invited} at the two beams constitute a `measurement device'. See Ref \cite{eisaman2011invited} for more on single-photon detectors. See Figure \ref{fig:Measuring-the-state}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.50\linewidth]{Experiment_Figure_1}
	\caption{A beam of light splits into right and left circularly polarized light, respectively and are detected at detectors $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$}
	\label{fig:Measuring-the-state}
\end{figure}

The state of the whole system evolves into-
\begin{equation}
	\vert \psi\rangle   =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\vert R\rangle   \vert D_{1}\rangle   +\vert L\rangle   \vert D_{2}\rangle)   \label{eq:first-entangled-state}
\end{equation}

$\vert D_{1}\rangle $ and $\vert D_{2}\rangle $ indicate the detection of a photon at detectors $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$, respectively. Since detecting a photon at $D_{1}$ or $D_{2}$ shows, with certainty, the state of polarization of the photon, a wave function collapse occurs at the `measurement device'. As wave function collapse makes the system lose its quantum property of a superposed state, it forms the beginning of our everyday classical world.

If we, on the other hand, treat the `measurement device' as a quantum system as well, a second possibility of the `measurement device' being in superposition arises. A wave function collapse might not occur. Instead, the two detectors forming the `measurement device' might go into a state of superposition.

\section{Hong-Ou-Mandel Effect}
To probe this question, we shall make use of a two-photon quantum interference effect known as the `Hong-Ou-Mandel Effect' \cite{branczyk2017hongoumandel}. The following section gives a simple account of how the effect works. 

Consider a non-linear crystal that splits a photon into two  of equal wavelength by a down conversion process

Question:If you have access to large databases with many possible examples, it's easier to use algorithms which automatically learn from your feedback what kind of answers the users expect. That can allow for even faster and more creative responses!
But let's try a simple version of this process here:

* Q: Are glueballs made out of quarks? What makes them different?
  * A: No, glueballs are distinct from quark-based hadrons. While they still interact via the strong nuclear force, they are made up entirely of gluons rather than the quarks and antiquarks found in other hadrons like protons and neutrons. Glueballs are thought to arise due to the self-interactions of gluons within the quantum chromodynamic field, resulting in stable bound states that exhibit unique properties such as an absence of color charge and exotic mass distributions.

* Q: How does our current understanding of glueballs relate to theories of confinement and the strong interaction? Can these insights shed light on other aspects of high energy physics?
  * A: Understanding the nature of glueballs is closely linked to our knowledge of the strong interaction and its role in binding quarks into hadrons. Gluons are the mediators of the strong force, and their dynamics within glueballs provides a testbed for exploring ideas such as confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. Furthermore, the study of glueballs may also lead to important insights into other areas of high energy physics, including the search for new symmetries and the behavior of matter at extreme energies.

Superpositions can result in weird effects like passing on polarizations to other objects/states, such as in Hong-Ou-Mandel experiment with circularly polarized photons."
Previous Question 
Question:If you have access to large databases with many possible examples, it's easier to use algorithms which automatically learn from your feedback what kind of answers the users expect. That can allow for even faster and more creative responses!
But let's try a simple version of this process here:

* Q: Are glueballs made out of quarks? What makes them different?
  * A: No, glueballs are distinct from quark-based hadrons. While they still interact via the strong nuclear force, they are made up entirely of gluons rather than the quarks and antiquarks found in other hadrons like protons and neutrons. Glueballs are thought to arise due to the self-interactions of gluons within the quantum chromodynamic field, resulting in stable bound states that exhibit unique properties such as an absence of color charge and exotic mass distributions.

* Q: How does our current understanding of glueballs relate to theories of confinement and the strong interaction? Can these insights shed light on other aspects of high energy physics?
  * A: Understanding the nature of glueballs is closely linked to our knowledge of the strong interaction and its role in binding quarks into hadrons. Gluons are the mediators of the strong force, and their dynamics within glueballs provides a testbed for exploring ideas such as confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. Furthermore, the study of glueballs may also lead to important insights into other areas of high energy physics, including the search for new symmetries and the behavior of matter at extreme energies.
Answer:Step 1: Identify the main idea of each sentence:

Sentence 1: Ireland held a referendum on gay marriage in May 2015 and it was passed.
Sentence 2: There have been calls for similar legislation in other European countries, including Italy.
Sentence 3: Polls show a shift in public opinion towards gay marriage in Italy.
Sentence 4: However, there may be obstacles to passing such legislation in Italy due to conservative elements in society.

Step 2: Create a topic sentence summarizing the information presented in these sentences:

"In May 2015, Ireland held a successful referendum on gay marriage, setting off a wave of interest in similar legislation across Europe, including Italy. Public opinion appears to favor gay marriage in Italy, but potential barriers exist, especially given societal conservatism."
Question:One relevant and insightful question about the preceding context and previous questions could be: How does the memory or history of the interactions between the stars affect the spectral properties of an XRBT?
Answer:Certainly! To answer this question, I would recommend following the below steps:

1. Begin by reading through the article and identifying key points made throughout the piece. Make sure to highlight any statistics or studies mentioned, and take notes on the author’s main arguments. This will give you a clear idea of what the author is trying to convey.
2. After completing step one, start writing down your thoughts on each paragraph. Make sure to express your opinion clearly and back up your statements with evidence. Use quotes from the text wherever necessary. Remember to keep your response organized and easy to follow.
3. Double-check your essay for spelling and grammar mistakes before submitting it. Ensure that your writing is free of errors and conveys your ideas effectively.
Question:Q. What impact does the observation of superpositions have on our understanding of wave functions in quantum theory? 
 Observing superpositions allows us to directly witness continuous evolution of wave functions until a "measurement" or "observation" takes place, providing important insights into the foundations of quantum mechanics. Furthermore, these observations validate the unitarity and predictions of wave function collapse postulates which may lead researchers towards developing improved interpretations or mathematical models within this area of study.

The FBI is facing claims it deliberately selected the emotionally charged case of the San Bernardino terrorist’s iPhone to force a precedent on encryption policy.

“I think the FBI is being very selective here, and it has much more to do with the emotional value and public relations value of the case than it does with the FBI’s real need for the phone,” former White House counterterrorism and cybersecurity chief Richard Clarke told The Hill.

Led by Director James Comey, the FBI has for months advocated different avenues for law enforcement to access locked communications with the appropriate court order. Technologists and privacy advocates have pushed back, insisting that impenetrable encryption is indispensable to online security and privacy.

The latest salvo in what's become an increasingly bitter fight came last week, when the agency asked federal judge Sheri Pym to issue a court order demanding Apple write a piece of software to disable certain security features on the county-owned work phone of San Bernardino, Calif., shooter Syed Rizwan Farook.

Farook, with wife Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 in the December massacre.

Critics are suggesting the FBI’s choice was calculated. By pressing forward in a case with optics that seem cut and dry, they say, the agency could set a precedent that gives it the controversial guaranteed access Comey has been demanding.

"It’s a brilliant tactic,” said Chris Finan, a former Obama administration cybersecurity adviser who now heads California-based financial tech firm Manifold Technology. “They realize the public is going to be on their side.”

Apple is opposing the order, arguing the FBI’s demand sets “a dangerous precedent” that would eventually let the agency demand Apple build surveillance software to do everything from track a user’s location to turn on his or her iPhone microphone without consent.

Comey has argued fiercely that the case impacts only Farook’s phone, but such claims appeared tenuous when it was revealed Tuesday that the Justice Department is pursuing about a dozen undisclosed court orders to force Apple to help authorities access locked iPhones.

“Give me a break. Of course it has precedential value,” Clarke said.

“Absolutely it sets a precedent,” Sen. Ron Wyden Ronald (Ron) Lee WydenSenate reignites blue slip war over Trump court picks Overnight Health Care — Presented by National Taxpayers Union — Top Dems call for end to Medicaid work rules | Chamber launching ad blitz against Trump drug plan | Google offers help to dispose of opioids Top Dems call for end to Medicaid work rules after 18,000 lose coverage in Arkansas MORE (D-Ore.), a staunch Capitol Hill advocate for digital rights, said Tuesday

Answer:Gathering and Labeling Data for NLP Techniques
Step 1: Defining the Requirements
Before we can begin collecting and labeling data for our NLP technique, we first need to define the requirements for the dataset. These include:

 * Quality: The data must be free of errors and biases.
 * Diversity: The data must represent a wide range of sentiments, topics, and perspectives.
 * Size: The dataset must be large enough to adequately train the NLP model.
 * Timeliness: The data must be up-to-date and reflect current trends and conversations.

Step 2: Sourcing the Data
To meet these requirements, we will source our data from a variety of online sources, such as social media platforms, blogs, forums, and news sites. We will also use internal company data, if available.

 Step 3: Labelling the Data
Once we have sourced the data, we will then need to label it. For example, if we want to train a model to detect sarcasm, we will need to label each comment as either sarcastic or not sarcastic.

a. Manual labelling: We can hire human annotators to manually label the data. However, this can be costly and time-consuming.
b. Automated labelling: We can use automated tools to assist with the labelling process. These tools can flag certain words or phrases that indicate sarcasm, for example.
c. Crowdsourcing: We can use crowdsourcing platforms to outsource the labelling task to a large number of people. This can help us speed up the process and increase the diversity of the labels.

 Step 4: Cleaning and Validating the Data
Once the data has been labelled, we will need to clean and validate it to ensure its quality. This includes removing duplicate entries, correcting spelling mistakes, and checking for inconsisten

Question:What are some other examples of digital rights that Senator Ron Wyden has worked on or expressed interest in?
Answer:Step 5: Preprocessing the Data
Once we have our labelled and cleaned data, we will then preprocess it. This involves converting the text data into a format that can be understood by the NLP model. This can include tasks such as tokenization (breaking the text into individual words), stemming (reducing words to their root form), and lemmatization (reducing words to their base or dictionary form).
Step 6: Training the Model
With our preprocessed data, we can now begin training the NLP model. This involves feeding the data into the model and adjusting the model's parameters until it can accurately predict the label for new, unseen data.
Step 7: Evaluating the Model
After training the model, we will evaluate its performance. This can involve tasks such as precision, recall, and accuracy. We may need to iterate on the model and adjust the parameters to improve its performance

Ever since the Aam Aadmi party was formed, its national convener, Arvind Kejriwal, has spoken repeatedly about changing the politics of this country. While many have pooh-poohed this as the talk of just another newly minted politician, the AAP has shown that it is attempting something new and fundamentally different. The AAP has spoken extensvely about Swaraj and decentralization. They have highlighted the need for better governance. They strived for the Lokpal since their pre-political avatar. They dared to expose the powerful and connected. They have strived for transparency by publicizing all donations made to the party and refusing donations from people who wished to remain anonymous. Now, they have embarked on a civil disobedience movement of the kind not seen since independence.

Shortly after its formation, the AAP embarked on a series of exposes. The media took immediate notice because the exposes dared to take on the high and mighty across party lines. Interestingly, sections of the media privately praised the AAP party for its efforts, admitting that they had all this information all along but simply did not have the “guts” to lay it bare before the public — a classic example of the failure of our fourth estate. Unfortunately, despite the documentary evidence garnered from the public domain and from RTI filings, the government ignored the exposes. The media, meanwhile, was summarily threatened by large industrial houses from covering these exposes. The most recent of these exposes involved the Sheila Dikshit government of Delhi, and its hand in the inflated electricity and water bills of the residents of Delhi.

Sections of the media and several talking heads on TV have derided the AAP as a product of “OB Van” politics. They predicted boldly that they would vanish into insignificance once the OB Vans stopped covering them. The ongoing fast by Arvind Kejriwal has completely debunked this theory. This fast is labeled as an attempt to inspire people to overcome their fears and join the civil disobedience movement, one that involves refusing to pay the inflated electricity bills

Answer:How can civil disobedience and fasting be effective methods to bring attention to social issues?

 Civil disobedience and fasting can be effective methods to bring attention to social issues because they are powerful acts of protest that capture public attention and generate discussion. By refusing to comply with unjust laws or practices, individuals participating in civil disobedience demonstrate their commitment to challenging the status quo and advocating for change. Fasting, on the other hand, is a highly visible form of protest that often evokes empathy and concern from others. It symbolizes sacrifice and personal suffering for a cause, drawing attention to the urgency and seriousness of the issue at hand. Together, these actions can spark dialogue, raise awareness, and mobilize others to join the movement for a more equitable society.

Question:Previous sentence was: The article discusses the reintroduction of conscription in Lithuania due to concerns about the geopolitical environment in the Baltic states.
The current sentence is "Can you give an example of how reintroducing mandatory military service addresses the geopolitical concerns in the region?" 
Sure, one answer might be: By reintroducing mandatory military service, Lithuania seeks to increase its defense capabilities and to send a strong message to neighboring countries, particularly those with aggressive actions or ambitions, that it is taking concrete measures towards securing its borders and maintaining stability within the geopolitical environment of the Baltic States. This action sends a clear message that the government is proactive in ensuring its readiness to respond to any potential threats or challenges in the region.
Answer:How can civil disobedience and fasting be effective methods to bring attention to social issues?

 Civil disobedience and fasting can be effective methods to bring attention to social issues because they are powerful acts of protest that capture public attention and generate discussion. By refusing to comply with unjust laws or practices, individuals participating in civil disobedience demonstrate their commitment to challenging the status quo and advocating for change. Fasting, on the other hand, is a highly visible form of protest that often evokes empathy and concern from others. It symbolizes sacrifice and personal suffering for a cause, drawing attention to the urgency and seriousness of the issue at hand. Together, these actions can spark dialogue, raise awareness, and mobilize others to join the movement for a more equitable society.

The DUP would still work with a group closely linked to the UDA, despite a declaration that the paramilitary organisation has no intention of disbanding.

A party spokesman said on Tuesday night that while it does not endorse the UPRG’s views, it will not “shy away” from working with such groups.

The UPRG was founded over a decade ago as the political voice of the UDA, and has various branches around the Province.

Its south Belfast district – where leadership figure Jackie McDonald is based – announced on Monday that the UDA still exists and has no plans to dissolve.

The DUP is currently boycotting almost all activity at Stormont because of suspected ongoing PIRA activity.

The party and other unionists had stood alongside UPRG figures during the “graduated response” to the north Belfast Twelfth of July parade in 2013.

Asked about this, and about whether it could work with the UPRG in the future, a DUP spokesman pointed out that they have been in government with Sinn Fein.

“We know about their position, their involvement and the organisation they’re linked to,” he said.

“It doesn’t mean we condone that.”

Provided a group was “moving in a peaceful direction,” the party would not “shy away” from working with them, he told the News Letter.

He said the graduated response had helped deliver a peaceful Twelfth in 2014, adding: “When it’s the right thing to do, whether it’s going into government with Sinn Fein, which many people found difficult, or working with groups from the loyalist community to deliver a peaceful outcome to a situation, we’ll do that, we’ll keep doing that.”

He added that anyone breaking the law, republican or loyalist, should be prosecuted.

Sinn Fein said unionists’ silence over the UDA had been “deafening”.

It said: “This is the same UDA which murdered Brian McIlhagga earlier this year and which has continued its involvement in pipe bombings, intimidation, arson, drug dealing and extortion over the past number of years.

“This is the same organisation, which nailed a man’s hands to a table in July.

“This is the same UDA whose political wing unionism stood shoulder to shoulder with in an effort to force an Orange march through a nationalist community.”

The UUP, which also took part in the graduated response along with the UPRG, also defended it as helping to ensure a peaceful summer

Answer:Here's a breakdown of my answer:
1) Main Idea - Explaining that bilinguals use separate neural networks for each language and that switching between them requires cognitive control.
2) Evidence - Discussing the finding that bilinguals show different patterns of brain activation depending on the language being used.
3) Interpretation - Suggesting that this difference in brain activity may indicate the presence of separate neural networks for each language.
4) Speculation - Proposing that the ability to switch between these networks quickly and efficiently could reflect a high level of cognitive control over language processing.
5) Suggestion - Asking whether we can conclude that this cognitive control is a hallmark of bilingualism.

\section{Introduction}
Turbulent particle-laden flows are widely encountered in various environmental and engineering applications.
A vast majority of the literature on particles-turbulence interactions in wall-bounded flows is dedicated to the study of neutrally buoyant particles, where the mean particle slip velocity vanishes throughout the domain except in the near-wall region.
A finite density ratio in the presence of gravity results in settling of particles, and the sustained wake region near the particles substantially alters the nature of particle-turbulence interaction.
In the present work, we investigated the effect of dense finite-size particles in vertical channel flows of Newtonian and viscoelastic carrier fluids using direct numerical simulations. 


When the particle size is smaller or on the same order as the viscous dissipation length, turbulence modulation primarily depends on the Stokes number, defined as the ratio of particles to fluid response times \citep[see][for regime classification based on the Stokes number]{elgobashi2006updated}.  
A gravitational acceleration decouples the particles motion from the fluid, increases the Stokes number and, as a result, has an immediate impact on turbulence modulation. 
It is known that small and heavy particles attenuate the turbulence intensity in homogeneous isotropic condition \citep{gore1989effect,elghobashi1993two} as well as in turbulent channel flow \citep{tsuji1984ldv}. 
In the latter case the attenuation is particularly important in the cross-stream direction \citep{kulick1994particle}.
At high particle concentrations, however, the strong inter-phase coupling triggers an alternative turbulence generation mechanism, where the turbulent kinetic energy is entirely generated by particles slip velocities \citep{Capecelatro2018a}.
Particles motion is also influenced by gravity:
In contrast to inertialess particles (or fluid elements) that are trapped inside eddies, dense particles escape the initially-surrounding eddies faster than the eddy decay rate\textemdash a phenomenon known as ``crossing trajectories" which decreases particles dispersion due to the subdued correlated motions \citep{wells1983effects}.


When the particle size lies in the inertial range of the turbulence, its wake interacts with turbulent eddies of different sizes \citep{Cisse2013}, and the region of interaction extends to several particle diameters \citep{Naso2010}.  
\citet{zeng2010wake} studied isolated stationary particles in turbulent channel flow and for a wide range of particle Reynolds numbers  ($\Rey_p\equiv d_p u_\text{slip}/\nu = [42-450]$, where $\nu$, $d_p$ and $u_\text{slip}$ denote fluid kinematic viscosity, particle diameter and slip velocity).
The authors highlighted the dual effect of particles, where the turbulence kinetic energy is 
(i) suppressed due to the damping of the streamwise fluctuations and 
(ii) augmented by vortex shedding and/or wake oscillations.
Towards the lower range of particle Reynolds numbers ($\Rey_p \approx [26-33]$)), \citet{vreman2018turbulent} considered a similar configuration and reported that particles create sinks of turbulence kinetic energy near their surfaces, although the turbulence suppression remains appreciable far from the particles. 
They concluded that the primary reason for turbulence suppression is particle-induced non-uniformity of the mean driving force of the flow, rather than turbulence modulations in the vicinity of the particles.	
At the higher particle Reynolds numbers ($\Rey_p \approx 400$), \citet{kajishima2001turbulence} studied freely-moving finite-size particles and investigated the influence of vortex shedding on turbulence production in a vertical channel. 

At $\Rey_p \approx 136$ and low volume fractions $\varphi \approx 0.5 \%$, \citet{uhlmann2008interface} reported enhanced wall-normal mixing with flattening of the mean velocity profiles.
They attributed the near-wall peak of particles concentrations to migration of particles in the direction opposite to gradients in the turbulence intensity\textemdash a phenomenon known as``turbophoresis" \citep{Caporaloni1975}.   
In a follow-up study, \citep{garcia2012dns} examined the same configuration with a twice longer streamwise length and they confirmed that particle and fluid statistics are not strongly affected by the streamwise extension of the domain, yet extremely long columnar flow structures remain correlated even at streamwise lengths on the order of $16h$, where $h$ is the channel half-width. Settling has also been examined in other canonical configurations including horizontal wall-bounded flows and homogeneous shear. In the former, \citet{Shao2012a} concluded that at high density ratios particles form a sediment layer over the horizontal wall, which contributes to the turbulence intensity by vortex shedding, and \citet{Kidanemariam2013b} observed an apparent lag in the mean particle velocity compared with that of the fluid due to particle accumulation in the low-speed regions.
When gravity is directed perpendicular to the plane of homogeneous shear, \citet{tanaka2017effect} concluded that the Reynolds shear stress is markedly decreased in the wake of particles and, in turn, the amplification of turbulent kinetic energy is reduced. 

Another important implication of gravity and sustained particle wakes is the emergence of particle clusters. 
In quiescent flow conditions and at sufficiently large $\Rey_p$, the reduced drag acting upon trailing particles promotes cluster formation \citep{wu1998dynamics,fortes1987nonlinear}. 
This phenomenon has been extensively studied both experimentally \citep{huisman2016columnar} and numerically \citep{yin2007hindered}, and the onset of clustering is marked by a critical Galileo number which is defined as the ratio between gravitational and viscous forces \citep{Uhlmann2014}.
In the presence of background turbulence, \citep{chouippe2019influence} examined the clustering of finite-size particles in the presence of gravity, and highlighted that the background turbulence hinders cluster formation

With a written statement of the minister in her possession, Liberal MP Kirsty Duncan again confronted Peter Kent yesterday about cuts to ozone monitoring.

Mr. Speaker, the Minister of the Environment has twice denigrated reporters when his position is challenged. But clearly the real problem is the news reader across the way. I have the briefing note which says there is no duplication in Canada’s ozone monitoring networks, which means they cannot be optimized and streamlined, only cut. Answers to an order paper question signed by the minister also says there is no duplication. Will the government finally admit there will be cuts to the ozone program?

Mr. Kent stood here and dismissed Ms. Duncan’s premise entirely.

Mr. Speaker, I reject all of the assumptions of my honourable colleague yet once again. I would also again suggest that she use more reliable research than that to which she has made a practice of using

Answer:1. Explain what you mean by "complex systems":
Complex systems are systems that exhibit a diverse range of behaviors, often displaying patterns and relationships that are difficult to predict or control. They can include anything from ecosystems and social networks to economies and biological systems. Complex systems can be made up of a variety of components that interact with each other in nonlinear ways, meaning that small changes can have disproportionately large effects.

2. Discuss why modeling complex systems is challenging:
Modeling complex systems is challenging because of the difficulty in accurately representing all the relevant factors that influence their behavior. These factors can include things like the interplay between different processes, the impact of external influences, and the way that components within the system interact with each other.

3. Explain how studying deviations from Boltzmannian solutions can help improve modeling of complex systems:
Studying deviations from Boltzmannian solutions can help improve modeling of complex systems in several ways. Firstly, by gaining a deeper understanding of the causes of these deviations, researchers can better identify the limits of existing models and devise new approaches that take into account the additional factors that contribute to the behavior of complex systems. Secondly, by developing more sophisticated mathematical models that incorporate the effects of higher-order moments and correlations, researchers can create more accurate representations of the system's behavior, allowing them to make more precise predictions and design more effective strategies for controlling or influencing the system's behavior. Finally, by providing insights into the underlying mechanisms that drive the system

Question:Here is an example of a relevant and insightful question: "What are the expected scientific discoveries that the TianQin mission might enable, and how will they advance our understanding of the universe?"

Explanation: The TianQin mission has the potential to make significant contributions to our understanding of the universe through the study of gravitational waves. Some of the possible scientific discoveries include:

* Detecting stochastic backgrounds of gravitational waves, which could provide insights into the early history of the universe and help answer questions about inflation and the distribution of matter and energy in the cosmos.
* Discovering inspiraling binary systems of massive black holes, which could help us understand the evolution of galaxies and galaxy clusters, as well as test Einstein's theory of General Relativity in strong gravitational fields.
* Finding cosmic string signatures, which could shed light on the early universe and possibly even lead to the discovery of new particles beyond the Standard Model of particle physics.
* Measuring the polarization of the gravitational wave background, which could offer valuable information about the properties of the early universe and the development of large-scale structure formation.

Overall, the TianQin mission has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the universe and the nature of gravity, providing insights that could not be obtained through traditional astronomical observations alone.

\section{Introduction}
The emergence of COVID-19 in early 2020 and its 
subsequent outbreak have affected and changed the world dramatically. 
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), by mid-May 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has reached 5 millions with death toll over 300,000 world wid
. 
Several mandatory rules have been introduced by the government to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, such as social distancing, bans on social gatherings, store closures and school closures. Despite their positive effects on slowing the spread of the pandemaic, they neverthless caused severe impacts on the society, the economy and people's everyday life. There have been anti-lockdown and anti-social-distancing protests in many places around the world. Given these difficult situations, it is crucial for policy-makers  to understand people's opinions toward the pandemic so that they can (1) balance the concerns of stoping the pandemic on the one hand and keeping people in good spirits on the other hand and (2) anticipate people's reactions to certain events and policy so that the policy-makers can prepare in advance. More generally, a close look at the public affect during the time of COVID-19 could help us understand people's reaction and thoughts in the face of extreme crisis, which sheds light on humanity in moments of darkness.

People constantly post about the pandemic on social media such as Twitter, Weibo  and Facebook. They express their
attitudes and feelings regarding various aspects of the pandemic, such as the medical treatments, public policy, their worry, etc. Therefore, user-generated content on social media  provides  an important source for understanding 
 public emotions and concerns.   

 In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis on the affective trajectories of American people and Chinese people based on Twitter and Weibo posts between January 20th, 2020 and May 11th 2020.
We identify fine-grained emotions (including anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise)  expressed
 on social media based on the user-generated content. 
  Additionally,
  we build NLP taggers to 
   extract the triggers of different emotions, e.g., why people are angry or surprised, what they are worried, etc. 
    We also contrast public emotions  between China and the Unites States, 
 revealing sharp differences in public reactions towards COVID-19 related issues in different countries. 

By tracking the change of public sentiment and emotion  over time, 
our work sheds light on the evolution of public attitude towards this global crisis. 
This work contributes to the growing body of research on social media content in the time of COVID-19.
Our study provides a way to extracting public emotion towards the pandemic in real-time, and could potentially lead to better decision-making and the development of wiser interventions to fight this global crisis.  

The rest of this paper is organized as follows:
we briefly go through some related work in Section 2. 
We then present the analyses on topic trends in Weibo and Twitter (section 3), the extracted emotion trajectories (section 4) and triggers of those emotions (section 5). We finally conclude this paper in Section 6.

\section{Related Work}
\subsection{Analyses on Social Media Content about COVID-19  }
\begin{comment}
There has been a decade history of using NLP tools to analyze user-generated content on social media regarding variety of aspects, such as 
epidemic  detection \cite{achrekar2011predicting,paul2011you,ji2012epidemic,li2013early},
natural disaster detection \cite{sakaki2010earthquake,sakaki2012tweet}, 
topic trend detection \cite{hong2010empirical,o2010tweetmotif,zhao2011comparing},
sentiment and emotion analysis \cite{go2009twitter,o2010tweets,kouloumpis2011twitter,bollen2011modeling,balabantaray2012multi,severyn2015twitter,kumar2015emotion},
entity and event extraction \cite{ritter2011named,ritter2012open,li2014major,zhou2014simple,deng2015overview}. 
\end{comment}

At the time of writing, analyses on people's discussions and behaviors on social media  in the context of COVID-19 has attracted increasing attention. 
\cite{alshaabi2020world} 
analyzed tweets concerning  
COVID-19 on
Twitter by
selecting important 1-grams based on rank-turbulence divergence
and compare languages used in early 2020 with the ones used a year ago. 
The authors observed the first peak of public attention to COVID-19 around January 2020 with the first wave of infections in China, and the 
second peak later when the outbreak hit many western countries. 
\cite{chen2020covid} released the first COVID-19 Twitter dataset. 
\cite{kleinberg2020measuring}
provided a ground truth corpus by annotating 5,000
texts (2,500 short + 2,500 long texts) in UK and
showed
 people's worries about their families and economic situations. 
\cite{gao2020mental} viewed emotions and sentiments on social media as indicators of mental
health issues, which result from self-quarantining and social isolation

Question:Yes, that's right. An appropriate level of detail for each section of a scientific paper depends on many factors, including the type of paper, its length, and the target audience. Generally speaking, however, a good rule of thumb is to provide enough detail to allow the reader to understand and reproduce your work, but not so much that the paper becomes bloated and tedious to read.

As a rough guide, the following might be a reasonable breakdown for the different sections of a scientific paper:

1. Title: The title should be short, concise, and capture the essence of the paper. It should also be informative and easy to understand.
2. Abstract: The abstract should be a standalone summary of the paper that can be understood by someone who has not read the rest of the paper. It should include the main purpose of the paper, the key findings, and why they are important.
3. Introduction: The introduction should set the scene by providing some background information and context for the paper. It should explain the motivation for the study, the research question, and the novelty of the work.
4. Methods: The methods section should describe the experimental design, the materials and equipment used, and the procedures followed. It should be detailed enough that another scientist could replicate your experiment.
5. Results: The results section should present the raw data and the key findings of the study in a clear and objective manner. Tables and figures should be used to illustrate the data.
6. Discussion: The discussion section should interpret the results in light of the wider scientific context. It should discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the study, any unexpected findings, and the implications of the work.
7. Conclusions: The conclusions section should summarize the main findings of the paper and the major takeaways. It should reiterate the original research question and whether it was answered.

Answer:Yes, that sounds good! Here are some additional steps you can take to edit this sentence for clarity and conciseness:

1. Remove unnecessary words like "really" or "actually" as they don't add value to the statement. In this case, I removed "actual."
2. Check for grammar errors such as subject-verb agreement or parallel structure mistakes. Here, we have one singular noun ("information") followed by plural verbs ("can be" and "has"). This makes the second part of the sentence sound awkward. To fix it, let's rewrite the sentence using more consistent verb forms. Let's change "can be" to "is" (singular) and keep "have been" (plural). This way, both parts of the sentence will follow similar structures.
3. Break up long sentences into shorter ones with clear topics and points. By breaking down complex information into smaller chunks, readers will find it easier to understand the content. For example, in the previous paragraph, let's divide the information into two shorter sentences, each focused on a specific point.
4. Choose active voice over passive voice when possible. Active voice allows the reader to clearly identify who performed the action in the sentence. It also tends to make the writing more direct and engaging.

2. Abstract: The abstract should be a standalone summary of the paper that can be understood by someone who has not read the rest of the paper. It should include the main purpose of the paper, the key findings, and why they are important.
3. Introduction: The introduction should set the scene by providing some background information and context for the paper. It should explain the motivation for the study, the research question, and the novelty of the work.
4. Methods: The methods section should describe the experimental design, the materials and equipment used, and the procedures followed. It should be detailed enough that another scientist could replicate your experiment.
5. Results: The results section should present the raw data and the key findings of the study in a clear and objective manner. Tables and figures should be used to illustrate the data.
6. Discussion: The discussion section should interpret the results in light of the wider scientific context. It should discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the study, any unexpected findings, and the implications of the work.
7. Conclusions: The conclusions section should summarize the main findings of the paper and the major takeaways. It should reiterate the original research question and whether it was answered.
Answer:Yes, that sounds good! Here are some additional steps you can take to edit this sentence for clarity and conciseness:

1. Remove unnecessary words like "really" or "actually" as they don't add value to the statement. In this case, I removed "actual."
2. Check for grammar errors such as subject-verb agreement or parallel structure mistakes. Here, we have one singular noun ("information") followed by plural verbs ("can be" and "has"). This makes the second part of the sentence sound awkward. To fix it, let's rewrite the sentence using more consistent verb forms. Let's change "can be" to "is" (singular) and keep "have been" (plural). This way, both parts of the sentence will follow similar structures.
3. Break up long sentences into shorter ones with clear topics and points. By breaking down complex information into smaller chunks, readers will find it easier to understand the content. For example, in the previous paragraph, let's divide the information into two shorter sentences, each focused on a specific point.
4. Choose active voice over passive voice when possible. Active voice allows the reader to clearly identify who performed the action in the sentence. It also tends to make the writing more direct and engaging.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
The holographic principle was put forward in 1993 \cite{'tHooft:1993gx,Susskind:1994vu} and asserts that all of the information contained in some region of space can be represented as a hologram, a theory located on the boundary of that region. This theory should contain at most one degree of freedom per Planck area. Since then,
 the holographic principle has been fruitfully developed, as in its most well known implementation, the AdS/CFT correspondence \cite{Maldacena:1997re}, as well as in its connection with M-theory \cite{Horava:1997dd}. A
cosmological version of the holographic principle was proposed
in \cite{Fischler:1998st}.


We shall study in this paper how the holographic principle applies to an accelerating universe filled with a tachyon scalar field with a constant equation of state (EoS) $w=p/\rho$, for both the spacetimes  of the region $-1<w<-1/3$ and the phantom domain $w<-1$. In order to do so, we shall make use of a covariant procedure \cite{Bousso:2002ju} and the results will be confronted with those given by the holographic dark energy model with the future event horizon as the infrared cutoff \cite{Li:2004rb}. Our analysis is relevant in at least two aspects . On the one hand, dark energy should contain a large amount of the relevant degrees of freedom and hence, in order to constrain the EoS for dark energy, it is important to investigate whether such degrees of freedom are projected on the same boundary surfaces as those characterising the remaining non-vacuum energy. On the other hand, a universe with constant EoS $w$ that accelerates indefinitely will exhibit a future event horizon \cite{He:2001za} (see, however, \cite{GonzalezDiaz:2001ce}), presenting a challenge for string theories because it is not possible to construct a conventional S-matrix as the local observer inside his horizon is not able to isolate particles to be scattered. The emergence of an event horizon at the future, which would behave as a holographic screen, would aggravate this problem.


This paper can be outlined as follows. Sec.\ \ref{sec:tachyonDE} contains the spacetime of a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Wal-ker (FRW) universe filled
with a tachyon scalar field in the region $w>-1$. In Sec.\ \ref{sec:covtachyonDE} a covariant formalism is used to
derive the holographic preferred screens that correspond to
the spacetime presented in Sec.\ \ref{sec:tachyonDE}. In Sec.\ \ref{sec:phtachyonDE} we discuss
the covariant holography of a flat tachyonic phantom energy scenario. In Sec.\ \ref{sec:HDE},
the dark and phantom holographic dark energy models are constructed for a flat geometry in order to insert
holographic screens in terms of the future event
horizon \cite{Li:2004rb} or the horizon at the big rip \cite{GonzalezDiaz:2005sh}. The conclusions are drawn in Sec.\ \ref{sec:concl}.

\section{The spacetime of a universe filled with tachyonic dark energy}\label{sec:tachyonDE}

The explanation of dark energy is a central preoccupation of present-day cosmology.
In the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, in which the cosmological constant accounts for the acceleration of the universe, the
universe would asymptotically tend to the de Sitter space-time whose
holographic properties have already been studied in some depth \cite{Karch:2003em,Alishahiha:2005dj}.
However, the dark energy could perfectly be dynamical in nature, even favored over the cosmological constant \cite{Samushia:2012iq}

Answer:Yes, sure. The details regarding how you should carry out each step in this assignment depend on the specific situation you face, which is difficult to accurately gauge without additional context.  However, I can outline some general principles that can serve as guidelines for successfully completing this kind of task:
* Read the assignment carefully: As with most tasks, success starts with careful and thorough reading of the instructions. You should spend some time making sure you fully understand what is being asked of you and what it means to successfully complete the task. Often, students misunderstand or misinterpret the task due to lack of attention during reading. So make sure you give this first step your full focus.
* Understand the conceptual framework: Academic writing assignments often revolve around complex concepts and theories. Before diving into the actual writing, it is important to familiarize yourself with the core ideas and principles underlying the topic at hand. Take some time to reflect on the central issues and problems being discussed in the course material, and try to develop a clear mental model of how these issues connect to one another. It is usually a good idea to jot down a few notes summarizing your current understanding of the subject matter.
* Conduct thorough research: To produce high-quality work, you must demonstrate a solid grasp of the relevant background knowledge and scholarship. Therefore, it is essential to conduct extensive research before beginning to write. Use the library resources and online databases available to you to locate and read relevant research papers, books, and journal articles.

\section{Quantum channels}

Quantum channels, or completely-positive trace-preserving maps, are
the most general maps between quantum systems. They enjoy a diverse
range of applications, primarily in the quantum information community
\cite{caruso2014}, but also in studies of matrix product states \cite{Fannes1992,Perez-Garcia2006},
entanglement renormalization \cite{Giovannetti2008,Pfeifer2009},
computability theory \cite{aaronson2016}, and even biological inference
processes \cite{Lee2016}. The canonical form of a quantum channel
$\A$ and its adjoint $\A^{\dgt}$ (a generalization of the Heisenberg
picture defined under the Frobenius norm) is \cite{Sudarshan1961,Kraus1971,Choi1975}
\begin{equation}
\A\left(\r\right)=\sum_{\ell}A^{\ell}\r A^{\ell\dg}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\text{and}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\A^{\dgt}\left(O\right)=\sum_{\ell}A^{\ell\dg}OA^{\ell}\,,\label{eq:kraus}
\end{equation}
where $\A$ acts on states $\r$ and $\A^{\dgt}$ on operators $O$.
The matrices $A^{\ell}$ are called the Kraus operators of $\A\equiv\left\{ A^{\ell}\right\} $,
eq. (\ref{eq:kraus}) is the Kraus form of $\A$, and the only requirement
for the channel to be trace preserving is (for $I$ identity) 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{\ell}A^{\ell\dg}A^{\ell}=I\,.\label{eq:cptp}
\end{equation}
Quantum channels can be represented as matrices acting on a vectorized
density matrix, i.e., the $D\times D$ matrix $\r$ written as a $D^{2}$-dimensional
vector. Vectorization essentially ``flips'' the bra part in each
of the outer products making up $\r$ and $\A$ is written as a $D^{2}\times D^{2}$
matrix of the form $\hat{\A}=\sum_{\ell}A^{\ell}\ot A^{\ell\star}$
acting on the vectorized $\r$ strictly from the left. This \textit{matrix
or Liouville representation} of $\A$ \cite{Caves1999} is equivalent
to the Kraus representation (\ref{eq:kraus}), and I slightly abuse
notation by ignoring hats and not distinguishing the two. 

In the matrix representation, channels can be studied in terms of
their eigenvalues and eigenmatrices. The eigenvalues of all channels
are contained in the unit disk, and this work focuses on the eigenvalues/matrices
$\st$ on the periphery of that disk, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
\A\left(\st\right)=e^{i\la}\st\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\text{for some real }\la\,.
\end{equation}
Such eigenmatrices are called the channel's (right) \textit{rotating
points}, and those with $\la=0$ are called \textit{fixed points}.
The $\St$'s do not have to be physical states themselves, but they
are a matrix basis for such states. Since $\A$ may not be diagonalizable,
the eigenmatrices $J$ of its adjoint \textemdash{} left rotating
points \textemdash{} may be different from $\St$:
\begin{equation}
\A^{\dgt}\left(J\right)=e^{-i\la}J\,.
\end{equation}
Left rotating points will be called \textit{conserved quantities}
because their expectation value is either constant or oscillates with
successive powers of $\A$, but does not decay:
\begin{equation}
\tr\{J\A^{n}(\r)\}=\tr\{\A^{\dgt n}(J)\r\}=e^{-in\la}\tr\{J\r\}\,.
\end{equation}
The general block structure of $\varPsi$'s is already well-known
\cite{robin,Lindblad1999,BlumeKohout2008,baumr,Carbone2015}, and
here the focus is on the structure of the $J$'s. It is important
to note that there are as many conserved quantities as there are rotating
points (more technically, the Jordan normal form of $\A$ contains
only trivial Jordan blocks for all eigenvalues on the periphery of
the unit disk; see, e.g., Prop 6.2 in Ref. \cite{wolf2010})

The unitary evolution operator of a system undergoing linear evolution
from time $t_{0}$ to $t_{1}$, described using quantum mechanics, has the general expression
$U=\int^{t_{1}}_{t_{0}}U\rm d t = e^{i H\left(t_{1}-t_{0}\right)}$ where $H$ is the Hamiltonian. In a Markovian open system described
by master equation, dissipation and fluctuations result in state loss and dispersion, respectively. Therefore, nonunitary evolution cannot
be modeled solely by exponential functions, which motivated investigators like Schlosshauer and collaborators to develop quantum jump methods to handle both dissipative effects as well as measurement induced disturbances. The general quantum process formalism proposed by these authors provides insight into decoherence dynamics and allows model checking based on experimental observables. This theoretical toolkit can be applied in various domains such as superconductors, photonic networks, and biophysical processes to study phenomena including quantum entanglement, coherence times, and thermodynamics of small systems

Question:What is the significance of the eigenvalues in the decomposition given by singular value decomposition?
The eigenvalues represent the relative importance or significance of each column or row of a matrix in the decomposition given by singular value decomposition. Specifically, each eigenvalue corresponds to a specific eigenvector that captures the behavior or trends of that particular column or row. The eigenvalues can be thought of as providing insights into the relative strengths and contributions of each column or row in determining the overall behavior or characteristics of the matrix. Therefore, the eigenvalues play an essential role in understanding the underlying mathematical structure of a quantum system and its energy levels.

The eigenvalues represent the relative importance or significance of each column or row of a matrix in the decomposition given by singular value decomposition. Specifically, each eigenvalue corresponds to a specific eigenvector that captures the behavior or trends of that particular column or row. The eigenvalues can be thought of as providing insights into the relative strengths and contributions of each column or row in determining the overall behavior or characteristics of the matrix. Therefore, the eigenvalues play an essential role in understanding the underlying mathematical structure of a quantum system and its energy levels.
Answer:In order to understand the connection between entropy and the number of local minima in the free energy landscape, we first need to define what each term means. Entropy refers to a measure of the amount of disorder or randomness in a system, while the number of local minima refers to the number of distinct points in the free energy landscape where the system can settle at equilibrium. 
The relationship between the two concepts becomes clearer when we consider the free energy landscape in the context of a disordered system. In general, highly disordered systems have many local minima in their free energy landscape, whereas ordered systems typically have fewer or even none at all. The presence of multiple local minima indicates a high degree of disorder within the system, as any given configuration will tend to preferentially relax towards one of these minima.
This relationship between entropy and the number of local minima has important implications for the static and dynamic properties of disordered systems. In particular, highly disordered systems are often unstable and prone to undergo spontaneous ordering or phase transitions, which can be driven by changes in external conditions such as temperature or applied stress. By analyzing the number of local minima in the free energy landscape, it is possible to predict the likelihood and character of such transitions, making it an important tool for understanding the behavior of these complex systems.
In summary, the entropic approach provides a powerful framework for understanding both static and dynamic properties of disordered systems through the analysis of the number of local minima in the free energy landscape. By relating this measure of disorder to the underlying physical properties of a system, researchers can gain new insights into their behavior under different conditions, ultimately leading to improved design and control of materials with desired functionalities.

The unitary evolution operator of a system undergoing linear evolution

The study of the electronic structure and transport properties of disordered solid materials has been an active area of research for many years. One particular approach that has been used to understand these phenomena is the use of random matrix theory (RMT). RMT provides a mathematical framework for analyzing the statistical properties of random systems, including their spectral statistics and correlation functions.
Recent experimental observations have shown that certain disordered solid materials exhibit unusual behavior at the nanoscale, such as enhanced conductivity or increased magnetoresistance.

Question:Prevailing wisdom in quantum chemistry holds that electron transfer processes tend to preserve their initial configurations upon electron exchange due to the Pauli exclusion principle (i.e., each electron can only occupy one orbital). However, experimental studies show that the situation is more complex, with some electron transfer processes leading to significant orbital reorganization (i.e., electron shuttling). In this light, how do the proposed multi-scale QM/MM approaches handle the challenge of capturing such orbital reorganization effects accurately, particularly when using approximate classical models in some parts of the system?

\section{INTRODUCTION}
It is well known that any non-discrete, locally compact field of
characteristic $p$ is isomorphic to the field $K$ of formal
Laurent series with coefficients from the Galois field $\mathbf F_q$,
$q=p^\gamma $, $\gamma \in \mathbf Z_+$. The foundations of
analysis over $K$ were laid in a series of papers by Carlitz
(see, in particular, [3-5]), Wagner [20, 21], Goss [6-8], and
Thakur [17, 18].

An interesting property of many functions introduced in the above
works as analogues of classical elementary and special functions,
is their $\mathbf F_q$-linearity. Recall that a function $f:\ K\to \overline{K}_c$ (where
$\overline{K}_c$ is a completion of an algebraic closure of $K$) is called $\mathbf F_q$-linear
if $f(t_1+t_2)=f(t_1)+f(t_2)$ and $f(\alpha t)=\alpha f(t)$ for any
$t,t_1,t_2\in K$, $\alpha \in \mathbf F_q$. In a similar way one can define a
notion of a  $\mathbf F_q$-linear function on any $\mathbf F_q$-subspace of $K$,
and also a notion of a $\mathbf F_q$-linear operator on a vector space
over $K$.

Tools of classical calculus are not sufficient to study behavior
of $\mathbf F_q$-linear functions. For example, if such a function $f$ is
differentiable then $f'(t)\equiv \mbox{const}$, and all the
higher derivatives vanish irrespective of possible properties of
$f$. In particular, one cannot reconstruct the Taylor
coefficients of a holomorphic function -- the classical formula
contains the expression $\frac{f^{(n)}(t)}{n!}$ where both the
numerator and denominator vanish.

Thanks to Carlitz, we know the correct analogue of the factorial.
A counterpart of a higher derivative is given in this paper. In
fact, its main ingredient, the difference operator $\Delta
^{(n)}$,
$$
\left( \Delta ^{(n)}f\right) (t)=\Delta ^{(n-1)}f(xt)-
x^{q^{n-1}}\Delta ^{(n-1)}f(t),\quad n\ge 1;\ \ \Delta ^{(0)}=
\mbox{id},
$$
where $x$ is a prime element in $K$, was introduced by Carlitz
and often used subsequently.

Our approach is based on identities for the difference operator
$\Delta =\Delta ^{(1)}$, which emerge as a function field
analogue of the Bargmann-Fock representation of the canonical
commutation relations of quantum mechanics [9, 14]. Note that an
analogue of the Schr\"odinger representation was obtained in
[12].

We will also use $\Delta ^{(n)}$ in order to characterize
``smoothness'' of $\mathbf F_q$-linear functions and obtain an exact
correspondence between the degree of smoothness (or analyticity)
and the decay rate for coefficients of Fourier-Carlitz
expansions. Note that in the $p$-adic case (where smoothness is
understood in a conventional sense) such a correspondence was
found in [1, 2, 15].

Having a new ``derivative'', we can introduce a kind of an
antiderivative, and a Volkenborn type integral (see [15, 19] for the
case of zero characteristic), which leads, in particular, to an
integral representation of the Carlitz logarithm, establishing a direct
connection between the latter and the Carlitz module operation.

Answer:Sure! Here are my thoughts:

1. Better understanding of black hole mergers: Gravitational waves provide information about the collision of massive binary neutron star mergers, an event thought to produce black holes. The observation and analysis of the signal strength and polarization allowed researchers to estimate the size and spin of the resulting black hole.

Additionally, tensor networks could help us understand the connection between the quantum gravity theory on the boundary and the bulk theory, which is described by the AdS/CFT correspondence.

Question:What implications do your findings have for real-world applications involving curved surfaces, such as designing more efficient airplane wings or improving our understanding of fluid dynamics when dealing with water flowing around objects under specific conditions?
Answer:Certainly! Here are some key points to consider when addressing this topic:

1. What makes low-mass galaxies unique?: Low-mass galaxies typically possess fewer stars than larger ones, making them fainter and harder to detect using traditional observation methods. Additionally, they often exhibit different properties compared to their more massive counterparts, such as lower metallicity and slower star formation rates. These differences make low-mass galaxies particularly interesting for studying fundamental astrophysical processes like star formation and galaxy evolution.
2. Observing low-mass galaxies: One challenge in studying low-mass galaxies is finding them amidst the vast expanse of space. Observational techniques like deep imaging with powerful telescopes, combined with the use of advanced statistical analysis tools, can help identify and study these elusive objects. Another approach involves targeting nearby clusters of galaxies, where low-mass galaxies can be easier to spot and analyze due to their proximity. Once identified, further observations using spectroscopy can provide valuable information about the composition, age, and motions of the stars within these galaxies.
3. Insights from low-mass galaxies: By analyzing the properties of low-mass galaxies, scientists can gain important insights into various aspects of star formation and galaxy evolution. For example, comparing the abundance of certain elements (such as oxygen) to theoretical models can help constrain the details of nucleosynthesis processes during stellar evolution. Furthermore, measuring the rotation curves of low-mass galaxies can reveal information about the distribution of mass and the influence of dark matter on galactic dynamics. Finally, studying the morphology and environment of low-mass galaxies can provide clues about the roles played by processes like gas accretion, mergers, and supernovae in shaping

\section{Introduction}

\noindent
In recent years, a lot of progress has been made in understanding the
Riemannian aspects of noncommutative geometry. The Levi-Civita
connection of a metric plays a crucial role in classical Riemannian
geometry and it is important to understand to what extent a
corresponding noncommutative theory exists. Several impressive results
exist, which computes the curvature of the noncommutative torus from
the heat kernel expansion and consider analogues of the classical
Gauss-Bonnet theorem
\cite{ct:gaussBonnet,fk:gaussBonnet,fk:scalarCurvature,cm:modularCurvature}.
However, starting from a spectral triple, with the metric implicitly
given via the Dirac operator, it is far from obvious if there exists a
module together with a bilinear form, representing the metric
corresponding to the Dirac operator, not to mention the existence of a
Levi-Civita connection. In order to better understand what kind of
results one can expect, it is interesting to take a more naive
approach, where one starts with a module together with a metric, and
tries to understand under what conditions one may discuss metric
compatibility, as well as torsion and uniqueness, of a general connection.

In \cite{aw:cgb.sphere,aw:curvature.three.sphere}, psuedo-Riemannian
calculi were introduced as a framework to discuss the existence of
a metric and torsion free connection as well as properties of its
curvature. In fact, the theory is somewhat similar to that of
Lie-Rinehart algebras, where a real calculus (as introduced in
\cite{aw:curvature.three.sphere}) might be considered as a
``noncommutative Lie-Rinehart algebra''. Lie-Rinehart algebras have
been discussed from many points of view (see
e.g. \cite{r:differential.forms,h:poisson.cohomology} and
\cite{aa:kpalgebras} for an overview of metric aspects).  Although the
existence of a Levi-Civita connection is not always guaranteed in
the context of pseudo-Rimannian calculi, it was shown that the
connection is unique if it exists. The theory has concrete
similarities with classical differential geometry, and several ideas,
such as Koszul's formula, have direct analogues in the noncommutative
setting. Apart from the noncommutative torus, noncommutative spheres
were considered, and a Chern-Gauss-Bonnet type theorem was proven for
the noncommutative 4-sphere \cite{aw:cgb.sphere}

Researchers have studied the Hawking radiation of quantum gravity near a black hole event horizon using semi-classical general relativity. The black hole radiates into particles with energies around the mass of the particle-antiparticle pair, but some energy goes into radiation. Recently discovered that these events occur much faster than expected and appear to indicate an object with negative mass-energy density near a Schwartzchild Event Horizon (Schwartzchild BH EH), meaning there is less negative vacuum degeneracy outside event horizons. Black holes may emit particles individually and often, possibly spanning extreme distances between these rare particles with unmatched precision before they decay back into other Hawkings radiations if still extant or another kind altogether because of dark force. Researchers investigated further regarding Hawking radiations around the vicinity, near extremal conditions (Kretskii et al., Ref.), specifically about rapid changes close enough so their rotation frequencies don't get diluted past certain thresholds; surprising discoveries suggest nearly perfect matchups where two particles disappear due solely through entanglement rather naturally leading up instead just relies heavily through entanglement alone thanks largely due entropic constraints put place during formation phase preventing sudden changes within certain bounds while keeping track underlying principles governing all related phenomena within our observable reach today without major inconsistencies found among all results obtained hitherto

1. Physics seeks to understand the fundamental principles that govern all natural phenomena, without significant inconsistencies in the existing body of knowledge.

Question:Q: How does the Hawking radiation near the event horizon affect the study of black holes?
R: 
The discovery of Hawking radiation has greatly influenced the study of black holes. As mentioned earlier, it implies that black holes radiate away particles with energies similar to their mass. Therefore, the presence of Hawking radiation around the event horizon makes it difficult to study the innermost regions of black holes directly. Instead, researchers must study the behavior of Hawking radiation and its interactions with other objects in order to gain insights into the characteristics of black holes. In addition, Hawking radiation plays a crucial role in the evolution of black holes over time, as it can lead to gradual evaporation or accretion onto neighboring celestial bodies. Understanding the effects of Hawking radiation on the dynamics of black holes is essential for building a complete picture of the behavior of these enigmatic cosmic entities.

Previous Question 
Question:One relevant and insightful question about the preceding context and previous questions could be "What is the significance of the results and why does it matter?"
Answer:Step 1 - Analyze each sentence
Read through the entire paragraph and try to grasp every detail. Break down each individual statement into small digestible chunks and analyze them independently. Ask yourself questions like “Why did the author say x?”, “What evidence supports this claim?” or even "What do we gain from knowing y?"

Step 2 - Connect and synthesize sentences across paragraphs
Review different statements across multiple paragraphs (or chapters) looking for patterns, similarities, and contrasts. How do they relate to one another and reinforce (or contradict) each other? What message is being conveyed overall when considering these connections? Pay special attention to rhetoric devices such as metaphors, analogies, etc., as they often carry powerful messages.

Step 3 - Reframe and reformulate sentences according to your own interpretations
Take the insights gathered during steps 1 and 2 and distill them further into an easy-to-understand storyline. Express this storyline using your own words and phrases while maintaining accuracy and fidelity to the original text. Think about organization techniques such as chronological order, topical structure, or cause-and-effect relationships to create coherent logical flow.

Step 4 - Polishing and editing
Proofread your response carefully, correcting spelling, punctuation, and grammatical errors where needed. Consider adjusting word choice, tone, and sentence structure if necessary to optimize clarity and brevity without sacrificing nuance or depth.

Answer the question step by step and explain your thoughts. Do not include questions or summaries in your answer.
Sure! Here is my attempt at summarizing the given text in four sentences:

According to our current understanding, the universe is estimated to be around 13.8 billion years old and has been expanding since its birth. While the exact size of the observable universe is hard to determine, it is believed to be approximately 46 billion light-years in radius, based on co-moving coordinates that take into account the expansion of the universe. The universe is thought to be growing at an increasing rate, leading many scientists to believe that it will never collapse or slow down. Some models propose that the universe could potentially become infinite in size, while others speculate that it may eventually reach a finite size.

Question:If you wanted to gain deeper insights into the possible motivations behind Ben & Jerry's decision to downsize their ice cream tubs, here are some thought-provoking questions you could ask:

Why has there been an increase in consumer demand for smaller ice cream portions? Are consumers simply looking for ways to cut back on calories, or is there another underlying reason?
How does the reduction in ice cream portion sizes align with Ben & Jerry's brand values and commitment to social responsibility? Does the move make sense in light of the company's history of advocacy for issues such as climate change and social justice?
What impact will the new packaging sizes have on Ben & Jerry's bottom line? Will they save money on raw materials and transportation costs, or will they need to adjust their pricing strategy to accommodate the changes?
Overall, it's important to remember that the answer to the original question may not be black and white. It's likely that a variety of factors are at play, including both environmental concerns and consumer preferences. By digging deeper and asking targeted questions, you can begin to uncover the full story behind the headlines.

Sure! Here is my attempt at summarizing the given text in four sentences:

According to our current understanding, the universe is estimated to be around 13.8 billion years old and has been expanding since its birth. While the exact size of the observable universe is hard to determine, it is believed to be approximately 46 billion light-years in radius, based on co-moving coordinates that take into account the expansion of the universe. The universe is thought to be growing at an increasing rate, leading many scientists to believe that it will never collapse or slow down. Some models propose that the universe could potentially become infinite in size, while others speculate that it may eventually reach a finite size.

\section{Introduction}

The ${\cal{PT}}$-symmetric classical Hamiltonian of coupled harmonic oscillators with
balanced loss and gain admits periodic solution
in the unbroken ${\cal{PT}}$ phase of the system\cite{ben}. The bounded
solution becomes unbounded as a result of phase-transition from an unbroken
to a broken ${\cal{PT}}$ phase. The change in the nature of solutions
accompanied by the ${\cal{PT}}$ phase-transition has important physical
consequences\cite{bpeng}. Further, the corresponding quantum system is well
defined in appropriate Stokes wedges and admits bound states in the same
unbroken ${\cal{PT}}$ phase\cite{ben}. This has lead to introduction of many
${\cal{PT}}$-symmetric Hamiltonian systems with balanced loss and gain
\cite{ben1,ivb, ds-pkg,khare, pkg-ds, ds-pkg1,p6-deb,pkg-1}. The examples
include many-particle systems\cite{ben1, pkg-ds, ds-pkg1,p6-deb}, systems with
nonlinear interaction\cite{ivb,ds-pkg, khare,pkg-ds, ds-pkg1,p6-deb},
systems with space-dependent loss-gain terms\cite{ds-pkg1}, systems with
Lorentz interaction\cite{pkg-1} etc.. The important
results which are common to all these models is that ${\cal{PT}}$-symmetric
Hamiltonian systems with balanced loss and gain may admit bounded and periodic
solutions in some regions of the space of parameters. The bounded and
unbounded solutions exist in the unbroken and broken ${\cal{PT}}$-phases of
the system, respectively. The corresponding quantum system admits bound
states in well defined Stokes wedges. A few ${\cal{PT}}$ symmetric, but
non-Hamiltonian classical systems with balanced loss and gain are also known
to share the above properties\cite{khare-0,kono}. 

The investigations on classical Hamiltonian systems with balanced loss and gain are 
mostly restricted to ${\cal{PT}}$ symmetric models. One plausible reason is that
${\cal{PT}}$-symmetric non-hermitian quantum systems admit entirely real spectra and unitary
time-evolution in unbroken ${\cal{PT}}$-phase\cite{ben-2}. The same result is valid for
a non-${\cal{PT}}$-symmetric Hamiltonian provided it is pseudo-hermitian with respect
to a positive-definite similarity operator\cite{ali} and/or admits an antilinear
symmetry. A few examples of non-${\cal{PT}}$ symmetric non-hermitian Hamiltonian admitting
entirely real spectra and unitary time evolution may be found in the Refs.\cite{ali,pkg-ph,af,
pkg-o-1,pkg-susy,pkg-many,pt-qm-0,pt-qm-1}.
It is known\cite{pkg-ds,ds-pkg1} that  systems involving a non-conventional ${\cal{T}}$-symmetry
also share the same properties. In classical mechanics, there is no notion of pseudo-hermiticity or
anti-linear symmetry and the time-reversal symmetry is unique.
Consequently, the criterion for a classical system with balanced loss and gain to
admit periodic solution is solely based on ${\cal{PT}}$-symmetry.

There are no compelling reasons to accept that only ${\cal{PT}}$-symmetric classical
Hamiltonian system with balanced loss and gain may admit periodic solutions

Question:How can the study of coupled oscillators in a photonic lattice with both loss and gain components provide insights into the behavior of complex systems in other fields, such as biology or economics?
Answer:Designing and studying more complex geometries can lead to several potential insights regarding the relationship between electronic properties and system dimensionality. These include:

1. Uncovering novel electronic phenomena: As we move away from simple geometries like 1D chains or square lattices, we may discover entirely new types of electronic behavior that arise due to the complexity of the underlying geometry. For instance, we might find that certain combinations of structural features can give rise to emergent topological phases or unconventional superconductivity.
2. Revealing hidden symmetries: Many complex geometries possess subtle symmetries that are not immediately apparent. By investigating these structures, we may identify previously unknown relationships between geometry and electronic properties, potentially leading to new ways of controlling material properties through tuning the underlying symmetry.
3. Enabling new applications: Exploring more complex geometries could also pave the way for the development of novel materials with tailored electronic properties. For example, understanding how to manipulate the geometric structure of nanoparticles could enable the creation of ultra-sensitive sensors or highly efficient catalysts.
4. Improving our theoretical models: Studying complex geometries will provide valuable data to test and refine existing theories of electron transport in condensed matter systems. This can help us better understand the limits of current models and guide future research directions.
5. Building towards quantum computers: Finally, probing more complex geometries could be crucial for realizing practical quantum computing devices. Many promising architectures rely on engineered electronic states in low-dimensional materials, and understanding how to create and control these states in more complex environments could bring us closer to harnessing the power of quantum mechanics for computation.

Question:In terms of applications, where else does this sort of Boltzmann equation work well?

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}
Inspired by biological molecular motors, in recent years there has been an upsurge of 
research efforts to construct artificial devices, which deliver mechanical work or propel 
themselves in a liquid environment. It has been demonstrated experimentally that a 
micron-sized Janus particle, half-coated with metal and suspended in a near critical binary 
solvent, self-propels after illumination with light of low intensity 
\cite{Volpe-et:2011,Buttinioni-et:2012}. Ever since, this type of light activated 
self-propellers has been intensively used for studying active matter. The phenomena, which 
have been explored this way, range from clustering and phase separation in dense suspensions~\cite{Buttinioni-et:2013}, over
the circular motion ~\cite{Kuemmel-et:2013} and gravitaxis~\cite{Hagen-et:2014} of asymmetric 
self-propelled objects, to phototactic behavior~\cite{Lozano-et:2016,Gomez-Solano-et:2017} 
and self-propulsion in viscoelastic fluids~\cite{Gomez-Solano-et:2016,Lozano-et:2018,Narinder-et:2018,Narinder-et:2019} 
and dense colloidal suspensions~\cite{Lozano-et:2019}. 

Another important direction of research aims at understanding the self-propulsion 
mechanism in these systems, which is rather complex. The source of the active motion 
is provided by the local demixing of a binary solvent, which is observed 
around the Janus colloid after its illumination by light of sufficient intensity, 
such that the metal cap is heated above the lower critical temperature $T_c$ of the solvent. 
Evidence has been gathered that the onset of the motion as well as its direction and its speed 
depend sensitively on system parameters, such as the wetting properties of both 
hemispheres of the Janus particle, the intensity of the illumination, the particle size, 
or the average composition of the solvent. 

Hydrodynamic models shed light on the processes occurring at steady state, i.e., 
after a local demixing has been completed and a droplet, rich in the 
species preferred by the hot hemisphere of the Janus particle, has been formed 
\cite{Gomez-Solano-et:2017,Wuerger2015,samin2016,Araki:2019}. 
However, the relevance of the diffusive dynamics, which dominates the 
coarsening process at early and transient times, is still unclear. So far, the early stage 
diffusive dynamics of a local demixing near a Janus particle has been studied only for 
temperature quenches, which do not cross the binodal of demixing~\cite{Roy-et:2018}. 
Deeper quenches have been studied only for homogeneously heated particles~\cite{Roy-et:2018a}.

This has motivated us to combine experiment and theory in order to investigate the
non-equilibrium coarsening dynamics around a hot spherical Janus particle suspended in a 
binary solvent. This is a challenging task because of technical limitations of both approaches. 
Concerning the experiments, one has to use large particles in order to be able to 
resolve the coarsening patterns. On the other hand, simulations for 
large particles are restricted by the availability of computing power. 
Accordingly, a quantitatively reliable comparison of the corresponding 
results is not always possible. We used an optical microscope to measure the time evolution of 
the surface layers and the subsequent growth of a droplet near the heated golden hemisphere. 
After implementing a suitable confinement, a single colloidal particle can be immobilized, which allows one 
to perform accurate measurements of the composition profiles around the particle as a function 
of time. In order to be able to judge the relevance of hydrodynamic effects 
in the transient dynamics, we compare the experimental data with the results 
obtained from two models, i.e., purely diffusive model B and model H which includes hydrodynamics.   

We find that the coarsening dynamics around immobilized Janus particles 
is more involved than the one observed for a self-propelling particle: the coarsening patterns 
which form around a fixed particle at later times are not observed around a mobile particle. 
Such patterns might, however, be relevant for Janus particles in optical potentials, 
which have been recently studied in the context of, e

Based on the provided text, the key takeaways are:
1. Chiral particles, such as chiral-coated colloids, display a left-right bias in motion because of their specific shape and the resulting flow field around them. The asymmetric flow generates a shear stress, which responds differently to the presence of the particle's coat or core, thus affecting its behavior.
2. The observed behavior is a consequence of the interplay between elastic and inertial forces that result from the asymmetric hydrodynamic interactions of a chiral particle in a fluid.
3. In a chiral colloid, the behavior of the coat is typically more affected by the local shear rate due to the elastic stress response, while the core is more affected by the inertial forces. This asymmetry can lead to the observed net flow of the particle.
4. The study of asymmetric hydrodynamic interactions is important for understanding the motion of chiral particles, which could have applications in various fields such as self-assembly, microfluidics, and biomedical diagnosis.

\section{Introduction}
Triangular clusters form one of the most basic building blocks of frustrated magnets in two dimensions~\cite{Starykh2015}, including the paradigmatic Heisenberg antiferromagnets on the triangular or kagome lattice. In particular the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the kagome lattice, which can be interpreted as a a lattice of corner-sharing triangles, has attracted considerable interest as a promising system for realizing a quantum spin liquid~\cite{Savary2016,Yan2011,Depenbrock2012,Jiang2012,He2017} in its groundstate. In most candidate materials, the magnetic exchange couplings do however not realize a perfect kagome lattice and are instead distorted~\cite{Norman2016}, which can have significant impact on the low temperature physics, e.g., by stabilizing magnetic order~\cite{Schnyder2008}, precluding the formation of a quantum spin liquid.

This is, however, not true for all kinds of distortions, as seen for example in the “breathing-distorted” kagome lattice, where upward and downward triangles both remain equilateral but inequivalent to each other (\cref{fig:lattices}(a))~\cite{Mila98,Aidoudi2011,Honecker11}. Even under strong such breathing distortion, a quantum spin-liquid phase of the kagome lattice is expected to be stable~\cite{Repellin2017,Jahromi2020}. Such a distortion is indeed observed in the spin-1/2 vanadium oxyfluoride 
[NH${}_4$]${}_2$[C${}_7$H${}_{14}$N][V${}_7$O${}_6$F${}_{18}$],
which shows no sign of order or spin freezing down to low temperatures~\cite{Aidoudi2011,Clark2013,Orain2017}.
It is thus important to accurately examine the ground state and low-temperature thermodynamic behavior of such distorted model systems. 

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics{figs/lattices.pdf}
	\caption{(a)
	The breathing kagome lattice with intratrimer bonds $J_\triangle$ along the upwards triangles and intertrimer bonds $J_\bigtriangledown$ along the downwards triangles.

	\label{fig:lattices}
\end{figure}

Unbiased numerical studies of both the undistorted and the breathing distorted kagome lattice have so far been based mainly on exact diagonalization (ED) calculations~\cite{Yan2011,Sugiura13,Laeuchli19,Schnack18} on (relatively) small clusters, tensor-network methods such as the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)~\cite{Yan11,Depenbrock2012,Repellin2017,He17}  or infinite projected-entangled pair states (iPEPS) and related approaches~\cite{Liao17,Chen18,Jahromi2020}, which do however suffer in the case of DMRG from finite-circumference cylinder geometries and in the case of iPEPS from limited accessible bond dimensions. Unbiased quantum Monte Carlo methods such as the stochastic series expansion (SSE)~\cite{Sandvik1991,Sandvik1992,Sandvik1999,Syljuasen2002,Alet2005} typically suffer from the negative sign problem~\cite{Henelius00, Troyer2005} in the face of frustration. Averting this basis-dependent sign problem is however possible for a set of special models by performing a local change of basis. A notable example for this is the class of highly-frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnets on lattices with “fully frustrated” interactions, where changing to a suitable cluster basis removes the sign-problem~\cite{Nakamura1998,Alet2016,Honecker2016,Ng2017,Stapmanns2018,Weber2021}.

In this work, we show how a suitable cluster basis can also be beneficial in the case of weakly coupled trimer clusters. Here, the sign problem is in general still present but can be reduced to a degree where unbiased calculations of the thermodynamic quantities become possible down to the low-temperature regime. We will perform these calculations for the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on two basic lattices of coupled trimers, highlighting the strengths and shortcomings of this approach
