It runs through downtown Portland and extends to both the Gresham and Hillsboro suburbs, the Portland International Airport, and to the Portland Civic Center. It\u2019s pretty accessible from most places and thankfully I live right next to a MAX stop out in Beavtown. So again, since I don\u2019t own a car, I ride this train a lot. I\u2019m pretty familiar with how the system works and where the stations are. I know there are three models of railcars in use and I\u2019ve ridden in all three types. Every now and then I\u2019ll be sitting towards an end of the car and notice the metal boxes located beneath the seats just outside the operator\u2019s station or cockpit. Inside these boxes appear to be sand.\n\nI\u2019ve often wondered what they were there for. I\u2019ve had my theories such as it was a safety device surrounding a fuel line to prevent fire, but that was quickly squashed when I remembered the trains are electric. It was a \u201cif an electric train is going east at 100 mph and the wind is blowing 10 knots S/SW, what direction is the smoke from the engine car blowing\u201d moment.

      "prompt": "Texas Professor Has Bright Ideas for Solar Power AUDIO By Mose Buchele Email\n\nTweet\n\nPhoto by Mose Buchele/StateImpact Texas\n\nBy almost any measure, 2011 was a rough year for solar power in the U.S. Federal subsidies to Solyndra became the focus of a congressional investigation after the company went bankrupt. Other solar outfits are feeling pressure on two fronts: low-cost Chinese-manufactured panels are driving prices down around the world, and electricity from America\u2019s newly unleashed natural gas reserves is making power from renewable sources seem less economical.\n\nBut at the end of the year, a scientist in Austin has brought a little sun into the forecast. Meet Xiaoyang Zhu, a chemistry professor at the University of Texas, and director of the Energy Frontier Research Center.\n\nFor the last few years Zhu and his team have been working on a way to dramatically increase the amount of energy harvested from Solar technology. Now, they think they\u2019ve done it.\n\n\u201cSo our recent discovery is this. If you have a light photon,\u201d he says to me, then pauses. \u201cI guess this concept is simple enough, yea?\u201d\n\nWell, maybe not for many of us. Here\u2019s a little background. Solar panels capture energy from light photons. But when the photon is too hot, with energy too high, traditional techniques only capture part of it. Most of the light converts to heat. Zhu\u2019s team has found away to absorb those photons into a plastic. To put them in what scientists call a \u201cdark state.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this dark state, this one electron hole pair becomes two electrons hole pair,\u201d Zhu says. \u201cOf course it\u2019s very difficult to describe in common language. You hear about this thing called quantum weirdness?\u201d\n\nAgain, I shake my head no.\n\nIt took some explaining \u2013 but here\u2019s the upshot: In this \u201cdark state\u201d Zhu was actually able to harvest two electrons of energy from one hot photon.\n\n\u201cSo, the conventional Solar panel. That efficiency theoretically is 31 percent. With our discovery the theoretical efficiency increases to 44 percent.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a more than 40 percent increase in the amount of energy that can be produced from a solar panel. But you can\u2019t do it with traditional silicone photovoltaic cells. Remember, I said Zhu\u2019s team has been using plastic to capture the energy.\n\nPhoto by Daniel Reese for KUT News\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 6 sentences.

      "prompt": "Starbucks\u2019 decision this week to ask customers to leave their guns at the door will please many of its loyal customers. Gun safety advocates are also claiming the move as a major victory and are promising to move on to other retailers that allow guns in their outlets. Nobody, however, should be as charged up as Elliot Fineman.\n\nEver since his son Michael was randomly murdered seven years ago by a paranoid schizophrenic while dining with his wife in a San Diego restaurant, Fineman has been on a crusade urging Americans who favor safe gun laws to make their presence known economically. Fineman, who founded the National Gun Victims Action Council, contends that political pressure alone will not shift the debate in favor of measures like universal background checks. There must be an economic impact as well.\n\nStarbucks\u2019 move is a big, tangible example of Fineman\u2019s strategy coming to fruition. In an open letter published today, the coffee-chain\u2019s chairman and chief executive Howard Schultz made \u201ca respectful request that customers no longer bring firearms into our stores or outdoor seating areas.\u201d Previously, the company\u2019s policy was to simply follow local \u201copen carry\u201d laws, though guns were prohibited from its corporate headquarters.\n\nIt is not a complete about-face for Starbucks. For starters, it is a request, not an outright ban. This is because the company says it doesn\u2019t want its baristas to confront armed customers. Additionally, according to Schultz, \u201cwe know we cannot satisfy everyone. For those who oppose \u2018open carry,\u2019 we believe the legislative and policy-making process is the proper arena for this debate, not our stores.\u201d\n\nSo while it may not be a perfect case study, it will do for Fineman. He first raised awareness of Starbucks\u2019 permissive gun-carry policy back in February 2012 \u2014 before the mass shootings in an Aurora, Colorado cinema, a Newtown, Connecticut elementary school and now the Washington Navy Yard reignited the gun debate. On Valentine\u2019s Day of that year, his group partnered with a couple of clergy organizations to launch a nationwide boycott of Starbucks stores and its products.\n\nBy Fineman\u2019s calculation, since the boycott began some 10,700 Starbucks customers had stopped dropping in for their lattes and cappuccinos, denying the company around $11 million a year in sales as of this April\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

      "completions": "Elliot Fineman, founder of the National Gun Victims Action Council, has been advocating for safe gun laws through economic pressure. Starbucks' previous policy allowed guns in stores following local laws, but after his group launched a boycott in 2012, the company has now requested that customers not bring firearms into its stores or outdoor seating areas. Although Starbucks' request is not a complete ban, it represents a victory for gun safety advocates. The boycott led to an estimated $11 million in lost sales annually as of April 2013, prompting Starbucks to reconsider its policy.",
