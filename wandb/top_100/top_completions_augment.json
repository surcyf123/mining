      "prompt": "For the past 36 years Frank Marks has accumulated thousands of hours probing the hearts and souls of hurricanes, getting to know them from their birth to their death. Now Hurricane Matthew, the first major cyclone to hit the U.S. mainland in 11 years\u2014is giving him still more quality time with a monster. Marks\u2014meteorologist and director of the Hurricane Research\n\nDivision at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory\u2014has been flying into the storm for the past several days and nights, along with some 18 other scientists, pilots, navigators and engineers. Every 12 hours they fly stretches of six to eight hours aboard one of NOAA\u2019s P-3 Orion aircraft, recently refurbished with new wings and engines.\n\nThey use the four-engine turboprop airplane as a huge stethoscope to monitor Matthew\u2019s vital signs. In these, as in larger NASA hurricane-hunter aircraft (such as a DC-8 used to study the genesis of the storms) each researcher sits before a console, a computer screen or a laptop mounted on metal racks where there used to be passenger seats. The screens show the flight profile as well as what the storm is doing in real time. Other monitors show rows of changing numbers reflecting the activity of the high-tech instruments connected to the outer fuselage of the aircraft: Doppler radars, microwave sensors, lidars, dropsondes, water vapor and aerosols spectrometers, and a suite of tubes to sample air, salt and dust particles, ice crystals and water drops.\n\nMeanwhile the cockpit is minding its own business. Pilots with good stomachs and steel nerves like Commander Justin Kibbey have to thread their way in and out of the eye, constantly passing through the calm-and-turbulence patterns typical of the galaxy-shaped storms. By now Kibbey and his colleagues are unperturbed by the constant barrage of emergency lights and computer messages\u2014any one of which might make any commercial flight divert to the nearest airport.\n\n\u201cWe are out there for situational awareness: knowing what is going on now,\u201d Marks tells Scientific American. \u201cOur job is to collect as many observations as we can to send to the National Hurricane Center in Miami, and to NOAA\u2019s numerical models center in Washington.\u201d And those models must be continually fed with new data as the storm advances. \u201cEvery six hours we put fresh data into each one of those runs, so that the models start the best way possible,\u201d Marks explains.\n\nNOAA's Orion P-3 in its Tampa MacDicc Air Force Base hangar. Credit: J. Cozic, NOAA\n\nThis is why, Marks adds, it is so crucial to actually go inside the hurricane. NOAA\u2019s storm behavior models can use satellite data, but that has many limitations because clouds obscure the sea surface. The storm-chasing aircraft\u2019s new scatterometer\u2014a microwave radar sensor that measures the reflection (or scattering effect) produced while scanning the surface of the Earth\u2014can see inside the storm with high resolution, something akin to a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Also new this season is an airborne Doppler radar, which offers \u201cthree-dimensional snapshots of the winds to show hurricane specialists what the hurricane structure looks like with height, which tells us something about how it\u2019s interacting with the vertical wind shear.\u201d\n\nThis weekend\u2019s missions are especially interesting for Marks because he will be deploying a new winged dropsonde for the first time in a strong storm. Called Coyote, it is a small motorized drone that is launched with its wings folded through an opening in the fuselage. It can fly for about one and a half hours, and according to Marks it is part of a new generation of instruments that are controlled by a pilot from a laptop on board the P-3. In 2014 it was deployed into Hurricane Edouard as a demonstration. \u201cBut this is the first time we deploy it in a major storm,\u201d Marks says\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 4 sentences.

These dinners, as well as the berries, became so popular that in 1940 Walter Knott felt the need to expand and bought a whole bunch of buildings from ghost towns across the country to create a themed ghost town in Buena Park. This was still 15 years before Disney could make that mouse of his a theme park of his own. It was also 24 years before Universal Studios Hollywood and 31 years before Six Flags Magic Mountain would even be a fever dream. By 1950 Knott would hold a summer long \u201ccounty fair\u201d as well as add other theme rides. And the rest, as we say, was history.\n\nSecond, aside from the amazing history of the park, and those delicious unique berries, you have to consider the price of the park in a comparative way when you consider what to do in California. Admission to Disneyland for one day for a family of four will cost you between 400 and 500 dollars. If you want to see as much of the parks as possible, you need to go multiple days\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

      "prompt": "In his book, In Two Minds: The Dilemma of Doubt & How to Resolve It, theologian Os Guinness wrote, \u201cIf ours is an examined faith, we should be unafraid to doubt. If doubt is eventually justified, we were believing what clearly was not worth believing. But if doubt is answered, our faith has grown stronger. It knows God more certainly and it can enjoy God more deeply.\u201d\n\nIn other words, no matter how strong our faith is, at some point we may experience doubt. But instead of being a sign of weakness, doubt can actually be something that causes us to dig deeper into our relationship with God, and can even make our faith stronger.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some prominent Christian thinkers, leaders and ministers who all wrote about struggles with doubt, faith and finding God through it all.\n\nC.S. Lewis\n\nOne of modern Christianity\u2019s most beloved authors and thinkers, Lewis is remembered for classics including Mere Christianity, The Chronicles of Narnia and The Screwtape Letters. But the renowned defender of the faith is also known for a more complicated side, famously writing, \u201cI have found that nothing is more dangerous to one\u2019s own faith than the work of an apologist.\u201d\n\nEven with all of his contributions to contemporary Christianity, Lewis led a somewhat controversial personal life, and at times wrestled with the intellectual side of faith.\n\nLewis warned readers of the hazards of relying on intellect\u2014particularly apologetics\u2014over spirituality, writing, \u201cThat is why we apologists take our lives in our hands and can be saved only by falling back continually from the web of our own arguments, as from our intellectual counters, into the Reality \u2014 from Christian apologetics into Christ Himself. That also is why we need another\u2019s continual help\u2014a [\u2018Let us pray for each other\u2019].

These dinners, as well as the berries, became so popular that in 1940 Walter Knott felt the need to expand and bought a whole bunch of buildings from ghost towns across the country to create a themed ghost town in Buena Park. This was still 15 years before Disney could make that mouse of his a theme park of his own. It was also 24 years before Universal Studios Hollywood and 31 years before Six Flags Magic Mountain would even be a fever dream.

This means that when people dream about coming to California, they are all dreaming about a gigantic mouse, or people with gigantic egos. I\u2019m not sure whether that means people are all dreaming of rodents or not. I guess it depends on what you think of that giant mouse. In either case, people have a little bit of tunnel vision when it comes to visiting Southern California landmarks.\n\nEnter Knott\u2019s Berry Farm, the red headed stepchild of Southern California theme parks. It is the theme park that sits half way bewtween the magic and grandeur of Disneyland and the thrills and chills of Six Flags Magic Mountain. And with Universal Studios having walking velociraptors and Transformers as well as adding the section of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, there is a second park competing in the magical realm. (Disneyland is still the champ. Sorry Universal.) It would seem like Knott\u2019s couldn\u2019t keep up with this theme park competition Apocalypse. Knott\u2019s has a few shows and a few thrill rides, but nothing like the Frozen show at the Hyperion theater, nothing like Harry Potter, and nothing like the thrills, twists, and turns of Batman the Ride.\n\nBut I want to tell you not to fall asleep on Knott\u2019s Berry Farm. Why should you not fall asleep on it like you would on your seat after the 30th name called in a graduation ceremony in a class of 10,000 students? (Hopefully you wake up for your friend\u2019s/child\u2019s name just before passing out once more.).\n\nFirst, I think you should consider the history of the park. This doesn\u2019t mean just the age of the park but seeing Knott\u2019s as a piece of U.S. history. In 1920, a full 35 years before Disneyland would open, Walter Knott opened a berry stand on what would now be called Beach Blvd. In 1934, because of the popularity of the Berry Farm his wife started cooking dinners for those who would have to wait for the berries. These dinners, as well as the berries, became so popular that in 1940 Walter Knott felt the need to expand and bought a whole bunch of buildings from ghost towns across the country to create a themed ghost town in Buena Park. This was still 15 years before Disney could make that mouse of his a theme park of his own. It was also 24 years before Universal Studios Hollywood and 31 years before Six Flags Magic Mountain would even be a fever dream. By 1950 Knott would hold a summer long \u201ccounty fair\u201d as well as add other theme rides. And the rest, as we say, was history.\n\nSecond, aside from the amazing history of the park, and those delicious unique berries, you have to consider the price of the park in a comparative way when you consider what to do in California. Admission to Disneyland for one day for a family of four will cost you between 400 and 500 dollars. If you want to see as much of the parks as possible, you need to go multiple days\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences. Do not try to create questions or answers for your summarization.\n\n",
      "completions": "\nKnott's Berry Farm is often overlooked compared to major attractions such as Disneyland and Universal Studios, but its rich history and unique features deserve recognition. Established in 1920, decades before most competitors, it provides an authentic glimpse into American history while offering family-friendly fun. Additionally, considering its affordability relative to rival theme parks, Knott's offers excellent value, making it worth exploring alongside the big names in SoCal entertainment.",

This means that when people dream about coming to California, they are all dreaming about a gigantic mouse, or people with gigantic egos. I\u2019m not sure whether that means people are all dreaming of rodents or not. I guess it depends on what you think of that giant mouse. In either case, people have a little bit of tunnel vision when it comes to visiting Southern California landmarks.\n\nEnter Knott\u2019s Berry Farm, the red headed stepchild of Southern California theme parks. It is the theme park that sits half way bewtween the magic and grandeur of Disneyland and the thrills and chills of Six Flags Magic Mountain. And with Universal Studios having walking velociraptors and Transformers as well as adding the section of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, there is a second park competing in the magical realm. (Disneyland is still the champ. Sorry Universal.) It would seem like Knott\u2019s couldn\u2019t keep up with this theme park competition Apocalypse. Knott\u2019s has a few shows and a few thrill rides, but nothing like the Frozen show at the Hyperion theater, nothing like Harry Potter, and nothing like the thrills, twists, and turns of Batman the Ride.\n\nBut I want to tell you not to fall asleep on Knott\u2019s Berry Farm. Why should you not fall asleep on it like you would on your seat after the 30th name called in a graduation ceremony in a class of 10,000 students? (Hopefully you wake up for your friend\u2019s/child\u2019s name just before passing out once more.).\n\nFirst, I think you should consider the history of the park. This doesn\u2019t mean just the age of the park but seeing Knott\u2019s as a piece of U.S. history. In 1920, a full 35 years before Disneyland would open, Walter Knott opened a berry stand on what would now be called Beach Blvd. In 1934, because of the popularity of the Berry Farm his wife started cooking dinners for those who would have to wait for the berries. These dinners, as well as the berries, became so popular that in 1940 Walter Knott felt the need to expand and bought a whole bunch of buildings from ghost towns across the country to create a themed ghost town in Buena Park. This was still 15 years before Disney could make that mouse of his a theme park of his own. It was also 24 years before Universal Studios Hollywood and 31 years before Six Flags Magic Mountain would even be a fever dream. By 1950 Knott would hold a summer long \u201ccounty fair\u201d as well as add other theme rides. And the rest, as we say, was history.\n\nSecond, aside from the amazing history of the park, and those delicious unique berries, you have to consider the price of the park in a comparative way when you consider what to do in California. Admission to Disneyland for one day for a family of four will cost you between 400 and 500 dollars. If you want to see as much of the parks as possible, you need to go multiple days\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

      "completions": " Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by reduced depth of breathing, particularly during sleep, leading to low levels of oxygen and high levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. The autonomic nervous system fails to respond appropriately to this imbalance, requiring affected individuals to rely on mechanical ventilation or a diaphragm pacemaker to assist with breathing. Symptoms appear soon after birth, with cyanosis evident upon falling asleep due to insufficient oxygen in the blood. Milder forms of CCHS may be diagnosed later in life. In addition to respiratory issues, those with CCHS can experience problems regulating heart rate and blood pressure, Hirschsprung disease, and an increased risk of developing certain nervous system tumors. Neurological complications and learning difficulties may arise from inadequate oxygen supply. Individuals with CCHS commonly display a box-shaped facial structure and decreased sensitivity to pain, along with decreased perception of temperature and periodic sweating. The outlook for people with CCHS depends on factors like severity, diagnosis timing, and the effectiveness of treatments, impacting both lifespan and potential cognitive disabilities.",

The 70\u2019s was also when Heuer made the radical and forward-looking move into the world of digital movements.\n\nOne special watch, The Chronosplit, the one that began Heuer's foray into the digital wristwatch space is the one we\u2019ll be taking a closer look at --the iconic Ref. 100-703 with its unmistakable and dual LCD/ and bright red LED display. Introduced in 1975 was truly a groundbreaking design and achievement. These have become increasingly rare vintage watches to find in working order as they were notoriously fragile electronic movements that were easily susceptible to battery/movement damage.\n\nThe Chronosplit was a totally different design direction for Heuer who didn't try to make these quartz solid-state based watches look like their existing line-up of mechanical movements, Heuer gave these watches their own unique design and celebrated the fact that these were ultra high-tech revolutionary watches --not cheap alternatives. The design direction was said to have been inspired by a trip Jack Heuer took to silicon valley when semiconductor development was making big new strides.\n\nWatch our video for a hands-on look at the Heuer Chronosplit LCD/LED Ref. 100-703\n\nBefore the watch was introduced, Heuer developed the first groundbreaking digital stopwatch called the Microsplit 800 (seen below). This became the basis for a smaller wristwatch version that would ultimately become the Chronosplit. Since the Chronosplit was developed as a professional grade tool, with its ultra-precise chronograph function, it quickly made its way onto the wrists of many notable Formula 1 racecar driver\u2019s hands who could rely on its accuracy such as Gilles Villeneuve (seen below)\n\nSpecial Chronosplit Versions\n\nHeuer also specially manufactured Chronosplits for Tiffany, Ferrari including the German military (-102-703-2 \u201cBund\u201d Military version). These watches were produced in exceptionally low numbers, and models like these are ultra rare vintage watches and can easily exceed $8-10K USD.\n\nUltimately, the LED\u2019s electronic movement issues led to Heuer to change the design in 1976 and introduce the Ref\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

It featured a LCD/LED display and came in a unique design, different from their mechanical watches. The idea behind the Chronosplit was influenced by a visit Jack Heuer made to Silicon Valley where he saw advancements in semiconductors.\n\nThe Chronosplit featured a precise chronograph and became popular among F1 drivers due to its accuracy. Special versions of the Chronosplit were created for Tiffany, Ferrari, and even the German military. Unfortunately, the electronics in the watch proved unreliable, leading Heuer to change the design in 1976 and release the Ref. 100-703/4 with improved electronics.",

Here's the look at these NVIDIA Linux results if you're wanting to find the graphics processor delivering the best value as a Linux gamer.\n\nSimilar tests will be published this week for my line-up of AMD Radeon graphics cards under Linux in looking at the performance-per-dollar/Watt, with the tests today looking at just the current NVIDIA Maxwell line-up of the GTX 750 Ti and all GTX 900 series parts. In a later article, pending sufficient reader interest, I may also do a similar open-source comparison in looking at what delivers the best value. In this article the NVIDIA 355.06 beta driver was used for testing all of the hardware.\n\nOur open-source automated benchmarking software, the Phoronix Test Suite, has long been capable of producing performance-per-Watt benchmark results when it's able to find a supported hardware sensor for querying the overall AC power draw. In the case of this GPU testing, the entire system power consumption was measured using a WattsUp power meter that's automatically read by the Phoronix Test Suite's Phodevi library. Usually in our Linux graphics card reviews we publish just a few performance-per-Watt results as it tends to be sufficient without information overload, but in this article are these extra numbers for each of the Linux games tested.\n\nThe performance-per-dollar benchmarking is a new feature in the Phoronix Test Suite Git code as of last week. I explained the performance-per-dollar benchmarking last week as the newest feature of our automated testing software. For this round of testing, the inputted graphics card costs were NVIDIA's current official prices for the GPUs where I was using NVIDIA reference samples except for cases where the tested hardware wasn't a reference sample, such as the EVGA GeForce GTX 950 FTW with it being a more expensive model, that price was used as listed on Amazon.com.\n\nThe tested line-up is the GeForce GTX 750 Ti, GTX 950, GTX 960, GTX 970, GTX 980, GTX 980 Ti, and TITAN X. Games were tested at both 1080p and 4K.

People with this disorder take shallow breaths (hypoventilate), especially during sleep, resulting in a shortage of oxygen and a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood. Ordinarily, the part of the nervous system that controls involuntary body processes (autonomic nervous system) would react to such an imbalance by stimulating the individual to breathe more deeply or wake up. This reaction is impaired in people with CCHS, and they must be supported with a machine to help them breathe (mechanical ventilation) or a device that stimulates a normal breathing pattern (diaphragm pacemaker). Some affected individuals need this support 24 hours a day, while others need it only at night.\n\nSymptoms of CCHS usually become apparent shortly after birth. Affected infants hypoventilate upon falling asleep and exhibit a bluish appearance of the skin or lips (cyanosis). Cyanosis is caused by lack of oxygen in the blood. In some milder cases, CCHS may be diagnosed later in life. In addition to the breathing problem, people with this disorder may have difficulty regulating their heart rate and blood pressure, for example in response to exercise or changes in body position. They may have abnormalities in the nerves that control the (Hirschsprung disease), resulting in severe constipation, intestinal blockage, and enlargement of the colon. They are also at increased risk of developing certain tumors of the nervous system called , ganglioneuromas, and ganglioneuroblastomas. Some affected individuals develop learning difficulties or other neurological problems, which may be worsened by oxygen deprivation if treatment to support their breathing is not completely effective.\n\nIndividuals with CCHS usually have abnormalities, including a decreased response of the pupils to light.

Autonomic responses normally triggered by such imbalances fail to materialize in those with CCHS, necessitating mechanical ventilation or diaphragm pacemakers to maintain proper breathing patterns. Symptoms generally manifest soon after birth, featuring cyanosis from insufficient oxygen levels and trouble managing heart rate and blood pressure during physical exertion or changing positions. Milder cases might go undiagnosed until adulthood. Furthermore, people with CCHS face increased risks for Hirschsprung disease, tumor development, learning difficulties, and various neurological complications, which can be exacerbated by suboptimal respiratory support.

But for the most part, they live on your phone and stay within the confines of your apps. Seeing them floating around the web, especially on a desktop browser, has always been something of a rarity.\n\nTumblr kicked down that wall a bit last year by adding Live Photos to its web version and releasing a tool to let others do the same. When it came to an official Apple-approved method, however, there was nothing to be found.\n\nThat quietly changed this morning, with Apple updating its developer portal with a new tool they\u2019re calling LivePhotosKit. It\u2019s a JavaScript API built specifically to bring Live Photo playback support to your sites.\n\nWe can\u2019t embed the Live Photos here just yet (or the way-better-than-GIF format WebM for that matter, hence the super-chunky GIF up top), but you can see a working example here.\n\nIt looks pretty slick in action, but Apple\u2019s example mechanism for triggering playback here\u2026 doesn\u2019t seem super intuitive.\n\nDo I click?

Here's the look at these NVIDIA Linux results if you're wanting to find the graphics processor delivering the best value as a Linux gamer.\n\nSimilar tests will be published this week for my line-up of AMD Radeon graphics cards under Linux in looking at the performance-per-dollar/Watt, with the tests today looking at just the current NVIDIA Maxwell line-up of the GTX 750 Ti and all GTX 900 series parts. In a later article, pending sufficient reader interest, I may also do a similar open-source comparison in looking at what delivers the best value. In this article the NVIDIA 355.06 beta driver was used for testing all of the hardware.\n\nOur open-source automated benchmarking software, the Phoronix Test Suite, has long been capable of producing performance-per-Watt benchmark results when it's able to find a supported hardware sensor for querying the overall AC power draw. In the case of this GPU testing, the entire system power consumption was measured using a WattsUp power meter that's automatically read by the Phoronix Test Suite's Phodevi library. Usually in our Linux graphics card reviews we publish just a few performance-per-Watt results as it tends to be sufficient without information overload, but in this article are these extra numbers for each of the Linux games tested.\n\nThe performance-per-dollar benchmarking is a new feature in the Phoronix Test Suite Git code as of last week. I explained the performance-per-dollar benchmarking last week as the newest feature of our automated testing software. For this round of testing, the inputted graphics card costs were NVIDIA's current official prices for the GPUs where I was using NVIDIA reference samples except for cases where the tested hardware wasn't a reference sample, such as the EVGA GeForce GTX 950 FTW with it being a more expensive model, that price was used as listed on Amazon.com.\n\nThe tested line-up is the GeForce GTX 750 Ti, GTX 950, GTX 960, GTX 970, GTX 980, GTX 980 Ti, and TITAN X. Games were tested at both 1080p and 4K. The Linux-native games benchmarked were Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Xonotic, Metro Last Light Redux, Metro 2033 Redux, Civilization Beyond Earth, BioShock Infinite, SuperTuxKart, Tesseract, and DiRT Showdown\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 4 sentences.

The article also mentions upcoming tests for AMD Radeon graphics cards.\n\n How can the performance-per-dollar and performance-per-Watt metrics help Linux gamers choose the best graphics processor?\n These metrics provide valuable information about the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of different GPUs for Linux gaming. By comparing the performance-per-dollar and performance-per-Watt values, users can identify which graphics card offers the best value in terms of both performance and energy consumption.",

Starting with the MacBook Air back in 2010, Apple started soldering RAM directly into the device. This continued with the MacBook Pro with Retina a few years later.

Now Hurricane Matthew, the first major cyclone to hit the U.S. mainland in 11 years\u2014is giving him still more quality time with a monster. Marks\u2014meteorologist and director of the Hurricane Research\n\nDivision at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory\u2014has been flying into the storm for the past several days and nights, along with some 18 other scientists, pilots, navigators and engineers. Every 12 hours they fly stretches of six to eight hours aboard one of NOAA\u2019s P-3 Orion aircraft, recently refurbished with new wings and engines.\n\nThey use the four-engine turboprop airplane as a huge stethoscope to monitor Matthew\u2019s vital signs. In these, as in larger NASA hurricane-hunter aircraft (such as a DC-8 used to study the genesis of the storms) each researcher sits before a console, a computer screen or a laptop mounted on metal racks where there used to be passenger seats. The screens show the flight profile as well as what the storm is doing in real time. Other monitors show rows of changing numbers reflecting the activity of the high-tech instruments connected to the outer fuselage of the aircraft: Doppler radars, microwave sensors, lidars, dropsondes, water vapor and aerosols spectrometers, and a suite of tubes to sample air, salt and dust particles, ice crystals and water drops.\n\nMeanwhile the cockpit is minding its own business. Pilots with good stomachs and steel nerves like Commander Justin Kibbey have to thread their way in and out of the eye, constantly passing through the calm-and-turbulence patterns typical of the galaxy-shaped storms. By now Kibbey and his colleagues are unperturbed by the constant barrage of emergency lights and computer messages\u2014any one of which might make any commercial flight divert to the nearest airport.\n\n\u201cWe are out there for situational awareness: knowing what is going on now,\u201d Marks tells Scientific American. \u201cOur job is to collect as many observations as we can to send to the National Hurricane Center in Miami, and to NOAA\u2019s numerical models center in Washington.\u201d And those models must be continually fed with new data as the storm advances. \u201cEvery six hours we put fresh data into each one of those runs, so that the models start the best way possible,\u201d Marks explains.\n\nNOAA's Orion P-3 in its Tampa MacDicc Air Force Base hangar. Credit: J. Cozic, NOAA\n\nThis is why, Marks adds, it is so crucial to actually go inside the hurricane. NOAA\u2019s storm behavior models can use satellite data, but that has many limitations because clouds obscure the sea surface. The storm-chasing aircraft\u2019s new scatterometer\u2014a microwave radar sensor that measures the reflection (or scattering effect) produced while scanning the surface of the Earth\u2014can see inside the storm with high resolution, something akin to a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Also new this season is an airborne Doppler radar, which offers \u201cthree-dimensional snapshots of the winds to show hurricane specialists what the hurricane structure looks like with height, which tells us something about how it\u2019s interacting with the vertical wind shear.\u201d\n\nThis weekend\u2019s missions are especially interesting for Marks because he will be deploying a new winged dropsonde for the first time in a strong storm. Called Coyote, it is a small motorized drone that is launched with its wings folded through an opening in the fuselage. It can fly for about one and a half hours, and according to Marks it is part of a new generation of instruments that are controlled by a pilot from a laptop on board the P-3.

      "completions": "The preceding message discusses the potential use of probiotics and prebiotics in preventing gestational diabetes. It highlights a study that explores the risk factors for gestational diabetes and questions if prevention is possible. The message also mentions the link between gestational diabetes, pregnancy hypertension, and late vascular disease. It introduces the concept of cobiotics, which combine a prebiotic and an antioxidant to improve glucose control and gastrointestinal tolerability. The message further explains how pregnancy can affect the gut microbiome and lead to metabolic changes. It touches on the benefits of probiotics in human medicine and the role of prebiotics in modulating the colonic microbiota. Finally, it mentions a study where consumption of synbiotic bread resulted in improved lipid levels in patients with type-2 diabetes.\n\n How do probiotics and prebiotics contribute to improving glucose control?\n\n Probiotics can help improve glucose control by modulating the gut microbiome, reducing inflammation, and enhancing insulin sensitivity. They promote the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut, which can positively impact metabolism. Prebiotics, on the other hand, provide nourishment for these beneficial bacteria, helping them thrive and produce short-chain fatty acids that support glucose regulation. When combined as cobiotics or consumed together as synbiotics, they have shown potential in augmenting the effects of medications like metformin and improving glycemic control.",

      "prompt": "Very few documentaries offer a glimpse behind a filmmaker\u2019s vision like the exceptional and riveting Jodorowsky\u2019s Dune. The documentary which had a dominate presence on last year\u2019s film festival circuit (playing at Cannes, Telluride, Toronto, Fantastic Fest, AFI, etc.) showcases a cosmic blast of creativity from the mind of a genius misunderstood by a system that never gave him a chance to orchestrate his version. The exploration of this mind is fascinating and required viewing for anyone who loves movies or wants to make one.\n\nSynopsis: In 1975, Chilean director Alejandro Jodorowsky, whose films EL TOPO and THE HOLY MOUNTAIN launched and ultimately defined the midnight movie phenomenon, began work on his most ambitious project yet. Starring his own 12 year old son Brontis alongside Orson Welles, Mick Jagger, David Carradine and Salvador Dali, featuring music by Pink Floyd and art by some of the most provocative talents of the era, including HR Giger and Jean \u2018Moebius\u2019 Giraud, Jodorowsky\u2019s adaptation of Frank Herbert\u2019s classic sci-fi novel DUNE was poised to change cinema forever. (c) Sony Classics\n\nJodorowsky\u2019s Dune is a enthralling reflection on a repressed artist who wasn\u2019t allowed to make his vision of the movie Dune. Another director ended up taking over the project and what we have is the disaster Dune as a testament to awful cinema. Jodorowsky discusses the pre-production challenges of creating that kooky world and how his dreams were dashed suddenly by the big studio system. The embrace of vivid detail was neglected for making money, yet the studio\u2019s version of Dune was a financial disaster.\n\nCreativity was stifled in this dashed opportunity to make something unique and even challenging. One of the people interviewed, Richard Stanley, made an excellent point about how studios want a simple description while pitching a movie (\u201clike Twilight meets Lord of the Rings.\u201d) Metaphysical big ideas scare the studios. Since most in that system are accountants and people focused on money, they want what generates the most revenue. Money is the issue with the studio system. Negative reactions to a risky movie re-enforces this studio fears, as shallow audiences are just as much to blame.\n\nCreative artists can view Jodorowsky\u2019s Dune with caution but optimism as well. Jodorowsky encourages artists to try to make the best work they can despite the studios who may try to hold them back. And in light of the loss of creativity, there was redemption of the repressed artist when the documentary explores his creative elements in future movies including Flash Gordon, Terminator, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Masters of the Universe, Contact, Prometheus, and Alien among others. This provides hope to other artists who can add elements of grand wit into larger than life, mainstream blockbusters. Sometimes those quirky moments in a big, bland movie are a way for a quirky filmmaker to challenge audiences. One day this classic documentary will inspire the current generation of younger filmmakers to experiment with the movie making process and empower them to not accept \u201cno\u201d for an answer.\n\nI rate Jodorowsky\u2019s Dune a 9 out of 10\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 6 sentences.\n\n",
      "completions": "The preceding message is a review of the documentary film \"Jodorowsky's Dune,\" which explores the failed attempt by filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky to bring his vision of the movie Dune to life. The review praises the documentary for offering a glimpse into Jodorowsky's creative mind and discusses how his artistic ambitions were stifled by the studio system. It highlights the importance of creativity and challenges faced by artists in a profit-driven industry. The review also mentions the redemption Jodorowsky found in later projects and how this serves as inspiration for other filmmakers. \n\n How does \"Jodorowsky's Dune\" shed light on the struggles faced by creative artists in the film industry?\n\n \"Jodorowsky's Dune\" showcases the challenges faced by creative artists in an industry driven by financial considerations. It demonstrates how studios often prioritize profit over artistic vision, stifling creativity and leading to uninspired films. However, it also offers hope by highlighting instances where filmmakers like Jodorowsky were able to inject their unique ideas into mainstream blockbusters, showing that creativity can still find its way despite these obstacles.",

Kent Sorenson gave his endorsement to the Texas congressman at a Des Moines rally.
