  "\\section{Introduction}\nUnder certain conditions, a gap can open in the spectrum of \nelectromagnetic waves in a dielectric medium, independent of the\ndirection of their propagation \\cite{Y,Jo}. \nDielectric structures possessing such a photonic band gap are promising \ncandidates for various technological applications \\cite{Y}.\nMoreover, such structures offer a new laboratory to study various \natomic processes. Indeed, if a gap opens in the spectrum\nof electromagnetic waves, all parameters and characteristics of atom\nplaced in such a medium,\nsuch as, for example,  atomic radius and its spontaneous emission rates\nare expected to change.\n\n\nIn order to open such a gap, one considers\nMaxwell's equations in a dielectric with a spatially periodic dielectric\nfunction, in full analogy to the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation\nwith a periodic potential \\cite{Y,Jo}. In the latter case, the spectrum can be \nclassified according to the Bloch momentum ${\\bf k}$. Energy (frequency) \nlevels $\\nu_n$ are continuous functions of the Bloch momentum ${\\bf k}$\nin the (first) Brillouin zone. \nWe say that there is a full gap, or simply a {\\em gap}\n between the $n$th and $(n+1)$th \nlevels when $\\nu_{n+1}({\\bf k})>\\nu_n({\\bf k}')$ for all  ${\\bf k}$ \nand ${\\bf k}'$. We say that there is a {\\em direct gap} between the $n$th \nand $(n+1)$th levels when $\\nu_{n+1}({\\bf k})>\\nu_n({\\bf k})$ for all  \n${\\bf k}$.\nFor the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation in one space dimension, the number \nof gaps is in general infinite and the only periodic potential which\ndoes not open any gap in the spectrum is a constant potential\n\\cite{E}. However, the situation changes dramatically in two and \nhigher dimensions. One can prove rigorously\nthat the number of gaps  in the spectrum can only  be  finite   \nand, if the  potential is not strong enough, no gap opens in the \nspectrum \\cite{S}. If electromagnetic waves are considered,\nopening a  gap in the spectrum is even \nmore difficult and it took several years of intensive\nsearch to achieve it experimentally for microwaves \\cite{YGL}.\nNote that Maxwell's equations enjoy scale invariance so that, in principle,\nby scaling all sizes of a given structure one can shift \na gap theoretically to whatever frequency range. \n\nSo far, the plane-wave method \\cite{ZS,HCS,SHI,SY,BSS} has been the main tool \nto calculate  the spectrum of electromagnetic waves in three-dimensional \ndielectric lattices. However, the plane-wave method is numerically\nrather unstable for a setup considered\nin experiment, namely when the dielectric function is piece-wise\nconstant and changes discontinuously \\cite{YGL,As,WV}.\nThe main culprit for this behaviour is the\nGibbs instability - the dielectric constant is poorly\nestimated near its spatial discontinuities by a truncated Fourier series\nwhich wildly oscillates\neven if more than one thousand  of plane waves is retained\n(see, for example, figure 2 of \\cite{SHI}).\nAlso, the plane wave expansion becomes impractical if the dielectric\nconstant exhibits a large imaginary part. \nAnother approach to calculate the spectrum \nof electromagnetic waves in three-dimensional \ndielectric lattices uses a discretization of Maxwell's equation\ninside the primitive cell of the lattice \\cite{Pen}\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

It is a way to transmit information over the Internet and that information can represent \u2018value\u2019 if the sender chooses to treat it that way. From a technical standpoint, it actually cannot be shut down without shutting down the Internet itself.\n\n(2) This technology/protocol cannot be un-invented. It has already been copied thousands of times and is replicated all over the world in multiple forms. Banning bitcoin is like trying to ban email, twitter, or text messages. It\u2019s really not practical.\n\n(3) Bitcoin is already being regulated by the US government. All exchanges which convert bitcoins into US dollars and back are under strict regulatory requirements.\n\n(4) Bitcoin works off of an open source public ledger that is 100% transparent. It does not come even close to representing a significant problem for law enforcement more than cash does today; this isn\u2019t just my opinion this is what was said at recent Senate hearings on the topic. It is important to remember that, of course, more illegal activity is done with the US dollar by orders upon orders of magnitude greater than ever has been done with bitcoin. Yes, criminals try to use bitcoins for illegal activities, just as criminals will try to exploit any value system, but they have been caught, repeatedly, and shut down. We don\u2019t make the US dollar illegal simply because criminals use it. We don\u2019t shut down the Internet, and email, and text messages, because criminals use it either. Likewise, shutting down bitcoin (which technically can\u2019t even be done) makes about as much sense.\n\n(5) Many people in government and the technology industry have been steadily working together to create a better regulatory environment for this powerful technology which could change the world of finance and lift untold millions out of poverty.\n\n(6) Our existing financial system uses ancient 1950\u2019s technology simply to transmit value around\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 6 sentences.

However, there are also several challenges such as volatility, lack of widespread acceptance, and concerns over its energy consumption.

However, there are also several challenges such as volatility, lack of widespread acceptance, and concerns over its energy consumption. Nonetheless, continued development and improvements could address these issues and further enhance the usefulness of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\nAnswer:1. Increased transparency\nBitcoin operates on a public ledger, providing a transparent record of all transactions. This can help reduce corruption and fraud by making it more difficult to hide illicit activities. Additionally, the decentralized nature of Bitcoin eliminates the need for third-party intermediaries, which can lead to a more efficient and transparent system.\n2. Lower transaction fees\nAs a digital currency, Bitcoin eliminates the need for banks and other financial institutions to process transactions. This can potentially reduce transaction fees for consumers and businesses alike, making it more cost-effective to send and receive payments.\n3. Faster international payments\nCross-border transactions can take days or even weeks to process using traditional methods. Bitcoin, on the other hand, enables near-instant transactions across borders, reducing the time and cost associated with international payments.\n\nAsk a single relevant and insightful question about the preceding context and previous questions.

  "\\section{Introduction}\nThere is a growing interest in the so called data science. Modern computers and clever algorithms have made possible to deal with massive amount of data and extract information for making more and more sophisticated models and predictions. The magic words are ``deep learning'' or ``machine learning''. These are fancy words to denote a set of tools that comprise linear algebra, calculus, statistics and optimization. Employers demand deep learning experts so for physics students some basic knowledge would be of interest. Here we present a problem which serves to introduce the student in those techniques of scientific computing while keeping the interest in physics topics. It is inspired on the celebrated paper ``Of flying frogs and levitrons'' \\cite{Berry285} which has been the guiding idea for the design of a levitating device to explore superfluity regimes \\cite{Arr21}. \n\nIn order to levitate diamagnetic materials, it is crucial to find the stability region of a given magnetic field configuration. The problem reduces to identify the place where the energy of the system obtains a minimum. To achieve levitation the total force on the object must vanish thus the gradient of the energy should be zero. However that condition is not enough, we also need to impose that the Laplacian of the energy will be positive, so the equilibrium is stable. Solving the problem involves to get the magnetic fields, and their derivatives, mostly in forms of gradients and Hessians. Here is where some techniques of machine learning are applied, in particular automatic differentiation (AD) which is at the heart of deep learning \\cite{Baydin18}. \n\nWe will study the particular case of finding the stability region in the field created by a circular current loop. The problem presented here gives us an extra bonus: the elliptic functions. There are available ready-to-try packages (both free and commercial) for deep learning applications ranging from image and speech recognition, genome-based taxonomic classification, drug research and so on. Normally the standard functions used in these packages are limited to a set of basic functions, like the sigmoids \\cite{Higham19}. When considering the magnetic field created by a circular loop we will be dealing with elliptic functions\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

Important examples include 1D spinless fermions, dilute Bose gases in 1D, and various spin one-half chains \\cite{giamarchi2004quantum,gogolin2004bosonization}.\nThe central dynamical fields of the TL formalism are the collective variables ${\\hat \\theta}(x)$ and ${\\hat \\phi}(x)$, which correspond to the phase and density fluctuations of a single-component system \\cite{haldane1981effective}.\nIn terms of these fields, the TL Hamiltonian is written as \\cite{giamarchi2004quantum,haldane1981effective}   \n\\begin{align}\n{\\hat H}_{0} = \\frac{\\hbar v_0}{2\\pi}\\int dx \\left[ K (\\partial_{x}{\\hat \\theta})^2 + \\frac{1}{K} (\\partial_x {\\hat \\phi})^2 \\right]. \\label{eq: tll model}\n\\end{align}\nHere $v_0$ is the zero-temperature sound velocity and $K$ is the TL parameter controlling the correlations of the system. \nThe canonical variables satisfy the commutation relation $[{\\hat \\phi}(x),\\partial_{x'}{\\hat \\theta}(x')]=i\\pi \\delta(x-x')$ \\cite{giamarchi2004quantum}.\nThe TL Hamiltonian also emerges as a renormalization group fixed point in the scaling limit of quantum critical systems, and defines the concept of gapless TLL phases \\cite{sachdev2011quantum}.\nIn the standard treatment of TLL theory, in order to evaluate physical quantities, Eq.~(\\ref{eq: tll model}) is diagonalized by using a Bogoliubov transformation for ${\\hat \\phi}$ and ${\\hat \\theta}$ \\cite{haldane1981effective,giamarchi2004quantum}.\nThen, within the harmonic-fluid approximation, the system is decomposed into free bosons ${\\hat H}_0 \\rightarrow \\sum_{k \\neq 0}\\hbar \\omega_{k} {\\hat b}^{\\dagger}_{k}{\\hat b}_{k}$, where $\\omega_{k}=v_0|{k}|$ is the linear dispersion.\nDue to this exact solvability, key quantities, such as the local magnetization or spatiotemporal correlation functions, can be evaluated analytically.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=80mm]{squeeze.pdf}\n\\vspace{-4mm}\n\\caption{\nSchematic illustration of the squeezed-field description for the TL Hamiltonian.\n(a) In the standard TLL description, the vacuum energy functional, whose value is determined from an equilibrium Bogoliubov-transformation angle, is static and elementary excitations of the vacuum are non-interacting bosons.\n(b) In the squeezed-field description, crudely speaking, the vacuum energy functional is allowed to breathe around an equilibrium state.\nAs a consequence, the bosons are scattered by fluctuations of the energy functional, giving rise to an effective coupling between $k$ and $-k$ modes\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 4 sentences.

  "On Christmas Eve in 2009, Ezekiel Gilbert paid an escort he found on Craigslist $150 for what he thought would be sex. Instead, according to the San Antonio Express-News, 23-year-old Lenora Frago left his apartment after about 20 minutes without consummating the act. Gilbert, now 30, followed her to a car with a gun and shot her in the neck through the passenger-side window. Frago became paralyzed, and died about seven months later. Gilbert admitted to shooting her but contended that he did not intend to kill.\n\nGilbert was tried for murder. Last Wednesday, a Texas jury ruled that his actions were legal. That\u2019s because Texas penal code contains an unusual provision that grants citizens the right to use deadly force to prevent someone \u201cwho is fleeing immediately after committing burglary, robbery, aggravated robbery, or theft during the nighttime from escaping with the property.\u201d\n\nTexas A&M Professor Mark Hoekstra, who studies the effectiveness of lethal-force provisions in self-defense law, says the protection-of-property element of the deadly force law is \u201cpretty unique to Texas.\u201d Within Texas, however, the case was not unique. In 2010, the law protected a Houston taco-truck owner who shot a man for stealing a tip jar containing $20.12. Also in Houston, a store clerk recently killed a man for shoplifting a twelve-pack of beer, and in 2008 a man from Laredo was acquitted for killing a 13-year-old boy who broke into his trailer looking for snacks and soda.\n\nTexas law also justifies killing to protect others\u2019 property. In 2007, a man told 14 times by a 911 operator to remain inside during a robbery gunned down two thieves fleeing from his neighbor\u2019s house. (\u201cThere\u2019s no property worth shooting somebody over, OK?\u201d the operator said on the call. The shooter\u2019s response: \u201cThe law has been changed\u2026.Here it goes, buddy! You hear the shotgun clickin\u2019 and I\u2019m goin\u2019!\u201d) He was acquitted the next year.\n\nSo-called \u201cjustifiable homicides\u201d are on the rise in Texas, where in 2007 Governor Rick Perry expanded already expansive lethal-force laws to allow Texans to kill in their vehicles and workplaces in self-defense or in any location to stop \u201caggravated kidnapping, murder, sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault, robbery, or aggravated robbery.\u201d Though the penal code has included the clause discussing \u201ctheft during the nighttime\u201d since the 1970s, some Texans might have taken the 2007 change as a declaration of open season. From 2002 to 2006, there were 146 cases of justifiable homicide committed by private citizens. From 2007 to 2011, the number jumped to 224, an increase of more than 50%.\n\nSuch cases have often drawn outrage and prompted communities to question the state\u2019s lethal-force laws. Proponents of lethal force in cases of self-defense say that crime rates have fallen in response to the laws. But a study conducted by Hoekstra and his colleague Cheng Cheng found that overall homicide numbers rose in the 21 states that adopted such laws between 2000 and 2010.\n\nChandler McClellan and Erdal Tekin, who study lethal force at the National Bureau of Economic Research, conducted research that confirmed Hoekstra and Cheng\u2019s results. \u201cTo the extent Gilbert\u2019s acquittal depended on a defense of justifiable homicide,\u201d they wrote, \u201cthe result is consistent with the notion that such force may not have been used except for the liberalization of laws meant to prevent homicide. Further, this acquittal could indicate to others that the use of lethal force is acceptable under a broad set of circumstances, thereby resulting in more violence. While the expansion of self-defense laws has slowed in the wake of recent high-profile cases such as Trayvon Martin, there have been no concerted efforts to roll back these laws or establish stricter standards\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

  "\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nDeep learning as such is based on the idea that concatenations of (suitably chosen) nonlinear functions increase expressivity so that complex pattern modeling and recognition problems can be solved. While initial approaches such as AlexNet \\citep{alexnet} only used moderate depth, improvements such as batch normalization \\cite{batchnorm,bn_covshift,bn_autotune} or residual connections \\cite{resnet} made the training of networks with hundreds or even thousands of layers possible, and this did contribute to significant practical gains.\n\nFrom a theoretical perspective, a networks depth (along with its width) is known to upper bound the complexity of the function that it can represent \\citep{vc_bounds} and therefore upper bounds the networks expressivity. Indeed, deeper networks are found to enhance performance \\citep{efficientnet}, but gains seem to taper off and saturate with increasing depth. Very deep networks are also known to be more difficult to analyze  \\citep{generalization}, more computationally expensive to train or infer and suffer from numerous stability issues such as vanishing \\citep{vanishing_gradients}, exploding \\citep{fixup} and shattering \\citep{shattering_gradients} gradients. Similar arguments can be made about layer width: a sufficiently large network can memorize any given function \\citep{original_uat}, but under standard initialization and training infinite width networks degrade to Gaussian processes \\cite{Jacot2018}.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, there are now many successful recipes for creating networks of a prescribed depth, but it is still difficult to understand -- empirically or analytically -- how many nonlinear layers and features per layer are actually needed to solve a problem, and how effective a chosen architecture actually is in exploiting its expressive potential in the sense of a deep stack of concatenated nonlinear computations.\n\nOur paper addresses this question from an empirical perspective: we use a very simple setup that associates every nonlinear unit with a cost at channel granularity, which can be raised continuously, while simultaneously trying to maintain performance. This is done by replacing each ReLU layer with channel-wise PReLU activations \\citep{prelu} and regularizing their slopes towards linearity. Such a linearized feature channel therefore only forms linear combinations of existing feature channels, thereby not effectively contributing to the nonlinear complexity of the network. Observing the partially linearized network can tell us \\textit{how many} nonlinear units are needed by a given network and also \\textit{where} they are needed. We measure the average amount of nonlinear units a given input traverses until it is classified disregarding subsequent linear mappings along computational paths, as these do not increase expressivity in a nonlinear sense. \n\nUsing tool, we make a series of experiments on common convolutional network architectures on standard computer vision tasks by partially linearizing networks after regular training, make the following observations:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\t\\item The amount of nonlinear units in the network can be reduced considerably before suffering larger performance losses and where the transition occurs depends on the difficulty of the task to learn.\n\t\\item The average amount of nonlinear units encountered along a path in the computation graph (\"effective depth\") of the resulting networks is very low before performance collapses.\n\t\\item When applying the same regularization strength to networks of varying width and depth, the effective width and depth is similar for all resulting partially linearized networks for a fixed task.\n\t\\item A network partially linearized at a later stage of training outperforms the same network partially linearized earlier. The biggest difference is notable in the early training phase.\n\\end{itemize}\nThese findings indicate, consistent with earlier hypothesis \\citep{lottery} that there is a core nonlinear structure in networks that forms during the first epochs of training whose shape depends on the task to solve and is largely independent of the shape of initial network chose.\n\\section{Related Work}\n\\iffalse\n\nA lot of work has been done to understand the implications of depth on expressivity, generalization performance and the function classes that can be learned efficiently. The well-known universal approximation theorem \\citep{original_uat} shows that a network with only one layer but sufficient width is able to ``memorize'' any function. Indirectly, this might suggests that the generalization capabilities of neural networks might be tightly linked to their depth. In this spirit, \\citet{narrow_uat} reformulate the well-known universal approximation theorem \\citep{original_uat} for deep and narrow networks; \\citep{debauchies} are studying what class of functions can be effectively approximated by deep ReLU networks\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

  "Given the heightened tensions on the borders, a plan to provide upgraded technology to India\u2019s forces on the border couldn\u2019t have come at a more opportune moment.\n\nAfter a nod from the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Border Security Force (BSF) has kick-started installation of a unique, indigenously designed virtual fencing system \u2014 Comprehensive Integrated Border Management System (CIBMS) \u2014 at two places in Jammu. The system is expected to go operational by March 2018.\n\n\u201cOur main thrust is to bring a sea change in guarding our borders by integrating latest technology and equipment. We\u2019re putting up two pilot projects under CIBMS in Jammu, which is unique in the world for guarding borders. Work order has been awarded and it\u2019s expected to go operational by March 2018,\u201d the director general of BSF, KK Sharma, told Firstpost.\n\nCIBMS is an integration of highly sophisticated equipment \u2014 like handheld thermal imager (HHTI), night vision devices (NVD), long-range radars, battlefield surveillance radars, etc \u2014 with manpower. It\u2019s a virtual fencing system.\n\nIt will be a shot in the arm of the Border Security Force (BSF) \u2013 the world\u2019s largest border force \u2013 that is engaged in guarding India's land border, with challenges such as infiltration of terrorists across the border into Kashmir and eastern states like West Bengal and Assam, and drug and cattle smuggling, among others.\n\nHow will CIBMS function?\n\n\u2014 Thermal imager indicates body heat signatures of any living being that moves towards Indian boundaries in the dark of the night at a distance of 3 km.\n\n\u2014 NVD, long-range radars, battlefield surveillance radars, etc catch slightest of vibrations at shorter distances.\n\n\u2014 Indigenously-developed infra-red intruder alarm, not visible through naked eye, alerts the BSF personnel. Anyone crossing the invisible infra-red wall within 700-metre range will get caught.\n\n\u2014 Analytical tools identify suspicious movements and distinguish between man and animal from the shadow.\n\n\u2014 Finally, based on inputs received, intruders (infiltrators or terrorists) will be eliminated.\n\n\u2014 Motion sensors have been included in CIBMS to save power and reduce electricity bill of Rs 90-100 crore (due to flood lights on borders).\n\nUnder the pilot project, two CIBMS will be installed for a length of 5 km each. Once it\u2019s successfully implemented, a similar system will be replicated at other places to protect the border.\n\n\u201cAt present, some of these equipments are in the hands of jawans posted on the borders and the possibility of human error can\u2019t be ruled out. But once this system becomes operational, it will be the latest in India on border-guarding, with the least human error. Israel was the first to have this system in place. We\u2019ve the proposal to install CIBMS along Jammu and Punjab bordering Pakistan. Our emphasis is also to plug the riverine gaps and there\u2019s a proposal to have this system installed at Dhubri district in Assam,\u201d Sharma said.\n\nBesides thwarting Pakistan\u2019s constant attempt to push militants through the border into India, like it did last at Nagrota in Jammu and Kashmir on 29 November 2016, countering narcotics and cattle smugglers is another big challenge for the BSF.\n\nNot known to many, the terrorists across the border attacked the army base camp at Nagrota and killed seven army personnel. On the same night at a distance, when three other terrorists were making their way through a tunnel, the BSF tracked and neutralised them.\n\nDespite severe constraints, the cattle smuggling, which is a complex issue due to geopolitical reasons, has declined from 20 lakh per annum in 2013 to less than 6 lakh in 2017 (as on date), with record seizure of animals in 2016.\n\n\u201cBangladesh border is 4,096 km long, out of which about 950 km is unfenced due to riverine belt. It\u2019s humanly not possible to cover this unfenced stretch. Smuggling takes place through this porous stretch, despite our patrolling and floodlights\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 4 sentences.

  "In my first week as a reference librarian in the Prints and Photographs Division of the Library of Congress, I was told by several colleagues that it takes at least a decade to get to know the collection. No wonder: P&P\u2019s collections contain nearly 16 million items.\n\nA noteworthy number of those items are stored in the reading room. Having worked in five other special collections libraries, all of them with closed stacks, I was amazed to find that the Prints and Photographs Division reading room has actual collection material in it and\u2014 with some guidance from reading room staff\u2014 patrons are permitted to browse through it. What a revelation!\n\nTake the Specific Subject File (SSF), which makes available some 20,000 photographs from various sources. Some of the contents have been digitized as researchers have purchased copies, but looking in the file lets you appreciate qualities of the digitized and un-digitized photos, alike.\n\nBecause it\u2019s organized by subject, the Specific Subject File is suited to topical browsing. Does fickle weather have you alternately thinking about a trip to the beach and a dusting of snow?\n\nResearching the long history of protest in American cities? There is no shortage of such images in the Specific Subject File, though you may need to look in more than one place.\n\nThe connections among the reading room files are endless. For example, you can find images of Washington, D.C. in several different collections in the reading room.\n\n\u03a4he Stereograph File reveals some aspects of life in our capital city that you\u2019ve probably never pondered. Ever thought about the quality control work that went into producing paper money in the early twentieth century? Well, here you have a visual representation.\n\nBrowse the biographical section of the Stereograph File and you might find stylized depictions of famous Americans, including John Brown and Frederick Douglass.\n\nFour stereograph viewers are available for reading room visitors to view these images in 3-D. Simply insert the stereograph into the viewer, look through the lenses and\u2014 voila!\u2014 you will be transported to another time and place.\n\nWalk over to the U.S\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

  "\\section*{Introduction}\r\n\r\nAs cooperation is costly, an individual is better off not cooperating. This leads to a tragedy of the commons where everyone ends up being worse off than if otherwise, all had cooperated \\cite{Hardin}. However, contrary to what a rational argument suggests, empirical evidence shows that tragedies of the commons are not that common in nature \\cite{Boyd}. Over the past decades, many efforts have been devoted to understanding how evolution has prevented tragedies of the commons and promoted high levels of cooperation \\cite{Boyd,Axelrod,Nowak,Perc2013}. Prisoner's dilemma, and its extension to $n$ players, public goods game (PGG), have been the most common frameworks in many of these studies \\cite{Doebeli,Axelrod,Nowak,Perc2013,Axelrod}. In the latter game, each player in a group of $n$ players can decide whether to invest an amount $c$ in a public good or not. All the investments are multiplied by an enhancement factor $r<n$ and are divided equally among the players. Defectors, refraining from investment, receive the highest payoff and are expected to dominate the population. This expectation contradicts observation \\cite{Boyd,Axelrod}. Past researches have revealed different mechanisms through which this puzzle can be solved. For instance, when interactions are repeated, cooperation can evolve due to the threat of retaliation of a defective act in future rounds \\cite{Hilbe2018a,Axelrod,Schmid2021}. However, in many cases, interactions are not repeated. A similar mechanism, indirect reciprocity \\cite{Milinski,Panchanathan,Schmid2021,Alexander2017}, based on which an individual's reputation determines others' behavior towards the individual can be at work to promote cooperation in non-repeated interactions. Similarly, punishment of defectors \\cite{Fehr,Perc,Boyd2,Szolnoki,Hauert1,Hilbe2,Salahshour2,Salahshour2021B} or rewarding cooperators \\cite{Rand,Attila,Hilbe} can promote social behavior. Cooperation can also evolve when interactions are not obligatory \\cite{Hauert,Szabo}, or when individuals have a choice between different institutions \\cite{Salahshour0,Salahshour2021A}. Furthermore, it is shown that the very existence of population structure can promote cooperation due to the assortativity of interactions in structured populations \\cite{Ohtsuki2006,Perc2013}. Other studies have shown assortativity \\cite{Iyer2020}, for instance resulting from kin selection, group selection \\cite{Nowak} or tag-based mechanisms \\cite{Riolo2001}, social diversity \\cite{Qin,Santos}, heterogeneity \\cite{Perc2011,Stilwell2020,Kun2013}, conformity \\cite{Hu2019,Szolnoki2015}, costly signaling \\cite{Salahshour1,Gintis}, moral norms \\cite{Salahshour2021C,Alexander2017}, and coevolution of cooperation and language \\cite{Salahshour2020}, to mention a few, can play a positive role in the evolution of cooperation.\r\n\r\nDespite the valuable insights reached on the subject, open questions regarding the mechanisms and conditions under which cooperative behavior is expected to flourish, remain to be addressed. A curious question in this regard is the existence of consistent cooperative and defective personalities. For instance, public goods experiments have shown that while about half of the people are conditional cooperators who are willing to cooperate provided their group-mates cooperate, others tend to free-ride on others' contributions \\cite{Fischbacher1,Fischbacher2,Burlando,Chaudhuri}. Similar observations regarding consistent personality differences in humans and animals, in different contexts, have been made \\cite{Bergmuller}. These observations raise the question of how such consistent cooperative and defective personality differences evolve, and if this can play a constructive role in the evolution of cooperation?\r\n\r\nTo gain a better insight into this question, here, I consider a context where individuals possibly play two consecutive PGGs. Individuals have independent strategies in the two PGGs. However, their strategy in the first PGG determines the PGG they enter for the second round\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

When a cell phone jammer is turned on it can block any cell phone service in the area. Using one isn't only a federal crime but it could result in a $16,000 fine and jail time.\n\nBut that didn't stop Eric, a man in Philadelphia, who was fed up with the chatty cell phone talkers on the SEPTA 44 bus. According to NBC 10 in Philadelphia, Eric would fire up that very jammer when he didn't want to hear the conversations.\n\n\"A lot of people are extremely loud, no sense of just privacy or anything. When it becomes a bother, that's when I screw on the antenna and flip the switch,\" Eric told NBC 10.\n\nEric claimed that he didn't know it was illegal to block a cell phone signal, and thought it was a \"gray area.\" He said he was under the impression that it was only illegal when blocking television or radio signals.\n\nBut even so, he wasn't very apologetic about his actions.\n\n\"I guess I'm taking the law into my own hands and, quite frankly, I'm proud of it,\" he told NBC 10.\n\nJammers like the one used in this case are illegal for reasons including that they could prevent cell phone communication in emergencies and because they can block other important signals such as police radio and other two-way radios.\n\nSince finding out it is illegal, Eric said he planned to dispose of the jammer he bought, which ABC News estimated cost $300.\n\nBut the bigger issue is that Eric isn't alone in this jamming practice.\n\nJammers are easy to buy at sites like phonejammer.com and jammerall.com, and Forbes reported that others in the New Jersey and New York area are using them, as well\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

  "A study on 159 healthy adults found that after a period of sleep deprivation, cognitive functions were impaired but restored with just one full night of sleep. Another study concluded that the optimum amount of sleep is seven hours per night, with cardiovascular disease risk increasing for those sleeping less than five hours or more than nine hours daily.\nPrevious Question \nQuestion:What are the key takeaways from these studies on sleep deprivation and its impact on cognitive function?\n\n Based on the two studies mentioned, there are several key takeaways regarding the impact of sleep deprivation on cognitive function:\n\nFirstly, even a single night of sleep deprivation can significantly impair cognitive functions such as attention and memory. This highlights the importance of getting enough sleep each night to maintain optimal cognitive performance.\n\nSecondly, the optimum amount of sleep for overall health and well-being appears to be around seven hours per night\nAnswer:What are the potential consequences of consistently sleeping fewer than five hours or more than nine hours per night?\n\n Consistently sleeping fewer than five hours per night has been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, while consistently sleeping more than nine hours per night may indicate an underlying health issue, such as depression or chronic pain, which could also have negative consequences if left unaddressed. It is important to prioritize getting the right amount of sleep each night to maintain optimal physical and mental health.\nQuestion:What strategies can people adopt to ensure they get the recommended 7 hours of sleep each night?\n\n To ensure one gets the recommended 7 hours of sleep each night, individuals should aim for consistent bedtimes, create a relaxing bedtime routine, avoid caffeine and electronic devices before bed, exercise regularly during the day, practice good sleep hygiene (such as creating a comfortable sleep environment), and address any underlying issues affecting their ability to fall asleep or stay asleep.\nAnswer:How can individuals strike a balance between getting enough sleep and managing their daily responsibilities?\n\n Striking a balance between getting enough sleep and managing daily responsibilities can be challenging but crucial for overall well-being. Individuals can prioritize their sleep by establishing a consistent sleep schedule, setting boundaries to ensure adequate rest, practicing stress management techniques, delegating tasks when possible, and optimizing time management skills. It requires conscious effort to prioritize sleep as an essential part of maintaining cognitive function, physical health, and productivity in daily life.\nQuestion:Q: What steps can people take to prevent cognitive impairment due to sleep deprivation?\nA: One study indicates that after a period of sleep deprivation, cognitive functions were impaired but could be restored with a full night's sleep.

By establishing a healthy work-life rhythm, individuals can optimize their energy levels, creativity, and overall well-being while minimizing stress\n\nQuestion:Q: How can sleep deprivation affect emotional regulation and decision-making abilities?\n\nA: Sleep deprivation can negatively impact emotional regulation and decision-making abilities. When we are not getting enough sleep, our brains struggle to process emotions and regulate mood effectively. This can lead to impulsive behavior, irritability, and poor judgment. Additionally, lack of sleep can impair our ability to make complex decisions, leading to poor decision-making choices. To improve emotional regulation and decision-making abilities, it is essential to prioritize sleep by creating a consistent sleep schedule, limiting caffeine intake, and engaging in relaxation activities before bedtime.\nAnswer the question step by step and explain your thoughts.

  "\\section{Introduction}\nDark matter in the Universe and stars in galaxies behave like a self-gravitating collisionless fluid of which the dynamics can be described by the Vlasov-Poisson system : \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot  \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}} -\\dfrac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}} \\cdot \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\mathbf{v}} = 0, \\label{eq:vlagen1} \\\\\n\\vartriangle \\phi = 4 \\pi G \\rho = 4 \\pi G \\int f(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{v}, t) \\mathrm{d} \\mathbf{v}, \\label{eq:vlagen2}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $f(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{v}, t)$ is the phase-space density of the fluid at position $\\mathbf{x}$, velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ and time $t$, $\\rho$ is the mass density and $\\phi$ is the gravitational potential. \n\n\nA major issue when considering the dynamics of gravitational systems such as dark matter halos, elliptical galaxies or star clusters in the non collisional regime is to understand the main processes underlying the creation of the quasi-stationary states that build up after a number of dynamical times, for instance the universal profiles of dark matter halos \\citep{NFW1,NFW2}. \n\nOne way to relate initial to quasi-equilibrium state is to assume that the system reaches some maximum entropy state after a {\\em violent relaxation} phase with strong mixing \\citep{LyndenBell}. However, the maximum entropy approach is at best partly successful \\citep[see, e.g.][and references therein]{Yamashiro1992,Arad2005, Arad2005b,Yamaguchi2008,Joyce2011} and the only way to improve the results is to introduce additional constraints and ad hoc ingredients \\citep[see, e.g.][]{Hjorth2010,Pontzen2013,Carron2013}. Indeed, relaxation might be incomplete, or maximum entropy state might not even exist, although one can generalize the concept of entropy by introducing the more general concept of H-functions \\citep{Tremaine1986}, for which there exist stationary points related to actual stable equilibria even if entropy maximum does not exist. \n\nAnother popular alternative to try understanding the establishment of quasi-stationary profiles consists in investigating the subspace of self-similar solutions \\citep[see, e.g.,][but this list is far from exhaustive]{fillmore84,bertschinger85,Henriksen1995,sikivie97,mohayaee06,alard13}. While it is difficult to actually demonstrate the onset of self-similarity, it seems to be a natural outcome of gravitational dynamics, at least in the absence of any characteristic scale. \nAlthough they exist as well in the warm case \\citep[see, e.g.][]{Henriksen1995}, self-similar solutions have been mostly studied in the cold case, for which the phase-space distribution function is of zero initial velocity dispersion. In this configuration, a $D$-dimensional phase-space sheet evolves in $2D$ phase-space and builds up a spiral pattern.\n\nThe above approaches, along with perturbation theory in cosmological systems \\citep[see, e.g.][]{ptreview}, provide some partial analytical framework to study the Vlasov-Poisson system. However, in general, these equations usually require a numerical approach, which consists in decomposing the phase-space distribution function on an ensemble of macro-particles interacting with one another with a softened gravitational force \\citep[see, e.g.][for reviews on the subject]{1988csup\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 6 sentences.

  "\\section{INTRODUCTION}\n\\label{sec:intro}\n\\vspace{-0.1in}\n\nFluorescence microscopy is a modality that allows imaging of subcellular structures from live specimens \\cite{bib:Piston1999, bib:Vonesch2006}. During this image acquisition process, large datasets of 3D microscopy image volumes are generated.\nThe quantitative analysis of the fluorescence microscopy volume is hampered by light diffraction, distortion created by lens aberrations in different directions, complex variation of biological structures \\cite{bib:Murphy2012}. The image acquisition process can be typically modeled as the convolution of the observed objects with a 3D point spread function (PSF) followed by degradation from noise such as Poisson noise and Gaussian noise \\cite{bib:Yang2015}. \nThese limitations result in anisotropic, inhomogeneous background, blurry (out-of-focus), and noisy image volume with poor edge details which aggravate the image quality poorer in depth \\cite{bib:SLee2018a}.\n\nThere has been various approaches to improve 3D fluorescence microscopy images quality. One popular approach is known as image deconvolution which ``inverts'' the convolution process to restore the original microscopy image volume \\cite{bib:Sarder2006}. \nRichard-Lucy (RL) deconvolution \\cite{bib:Richard1972, bib:Lucy1974} which maximizes the likelihood distribution based on a Poisson noise assumption for confocal microscopy was proposed. This RL deconvolution was further extended in \\cite{bib:Dey2006} that incorporated the total variation as a regularization term in the cost function. Since the PSF is usually not known, blind deconvolution which estimates the PSF and the original image simultaneously is favorable \\cite{bib:Shajkofci2018}. Blind deconvolution using RL deconvolution was described in \\cite{bib:Fish1995}. A pupil model for the PSF was presented in \\cite{bib:Soulez2012} and the PSF was estimated using machine learning approaches in \\cite{bib:Kenig2010}. Sparse coding to learn 2D features for coarse resolution along the depth axis to mitigate anisotropic issues was presented in \\cite{bib:Soulez2014}.\n\nAnother approach to achieve better image quality stems from image denoising research. \nOne example is Poisson noise removal using a combination of the Haar wavelet and the linear expansion of thresholds (PURE-LET) proposed in \\cite{bib:PureDenoise}. This PURE-LET approach was extended further to 3D widefield microscopy in \\cite{bib:JLi2017}. Additionally, a denoising and deblurring method for Poisson noise corrupted data using variance stabilizing transforms (VST) was described in \\cite{bib:Azzari2017}. Meanwhile, a 3D inhomogeneity correction method that combines 3D active contours segmentation was presented in \\cite{bib:SLee2017}. \n\nConvolutional neural network (CNN) has been popular to address various problems in medical image analysis and computer vision  such as image denoising, image segmentation, and image registration \\cite{bib:Litjens2017}.\nThere are few papers that focus on image deconvolution in fluorescence microscopy using CNNs. \nOne example is an anisotropic fluorescence microscopy restoration method using a CNN \\cite{bib:Weigert2017}. Later, semi-blind spatially-variant deconvolution in optical microscopy with a local PSF using a CNN was described in \\cite{bib:Shajkofci2018}\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

  "Congress Gives Itself More Free Parking Than Its Own Rules Allow\n\nAs TransitCenter and the Frontier Group reported last week, the federal government pays a huge $7.3 billion subsidy to people who drive to work by making commuter parking expenses tax exempt. There are countless reasons for Congress to scrap this poorly-conceived, congestion-inducing subsidy. While policymakers consider the big picture, they also ought to examine how their own parking benefits are administered.\n\nHere\u2019s the short version: Congress is breaking its own law, and it\u2019s shorting the Treasury hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, by providing free parking far in excess of the allowable limits.\n\nUSC 26 Section 132f of the tax code allows employers to provide each worker with up to $250 in free parking per month tax-free, which can add up to $3,000 in tax-free perks per employee each year. That\u2019s a pretty big amount to pay people for exacerbating congestion, but the parking at the U.S. Capitol is worth significantly more than that.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know exactly how many free parking spaces we\u2019re talking about. The Architect of the Capitol and relevant committees don\u2019t like to talk about it, but Lydia DePillis reported in the Washington City Paper a few years ago that a plan for the southern part of the Capitol complex completed in 2005 shows that the House office buildings alone have 5,772 parking spaces assigned to them.\n\nTo figure out the market value of those spots, it would help to be able to check the rates at adjacent private lots. The problem is: There are no adjacent private lots.\n\nAccording to SpotHero, there are no available monthly parking spots within a mile of the Capitol. The closest one \u2014 about a 20 minute walk to either the House side or the Senate side \u2014 costs $270.\n\nThere are some cheaper options a little farther away, but the cost of parking more than a mile from the destination is almost inconsequential. Given the extreme scarcity of parking near the Capitol, which employs and attracts tens of thousands of people daily, you can bet that on-site parking is worth significantly more than faraway options. Moreover, if so many employees didn\u2019t get free parking on the Capitol grounds, how would that affect demand, and therefore parking rates, at surrounding lots?\n\nAccording to the law, if an employee is provided with free parking in excess of the allowable limit, the difference should be reported as taxable income, and the employer would have to pay all the normal employment taxes (Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid, etc.) on that portion.\n\nIRS staff affirm that the value of any fringe benefit is based on the market. Congress can\u2019t just say the parking is worth $250 and call it a day. They have to acknowledge that the benefit they are providing to staff and members is worth the market price. In the case of a reserved parking space directly on the Capitol grounds, it is likely worth much more than the $270 per month established by the adjacent market for parking.\n\nWith this understanding, every staffer and member of Congress receiving free parking is not paying tax on at least $240 in annual compensation \u2014 and that is a minimum estimate. Having seen staffers\u2019 pay stubs, I can verify that they are not paying the full value of the parking provided. The failure to report and tax this additional income easily costs the Treasury hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.\n\nThe scandalous part is that this is a rule that Congress directly controls\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 6 sentences.

  "Donald Trump's origin story tells the tale of a scrappy kid who made his own way to a golden throne in a Manhattan penthouse with nothing more than a small, million-dollar \"loan\" from his father. But the reality is that Fred Trump had to help out his son much more significantly, because, as we all now know, his son is a big-time business loser.\n\nDonald Trump is not the wildly successful businessman he has portrayed himself to be.\n\nAnd following his devastatingly bad business decisions in the 1980s \u2014 many of which are detailed in this 1990 Fortune profile \u2014 Trump was obliged to turn to his father for multiple bailouts. The New York Times reports:\n\nMr. Trump, the Republican nominee for president, portrays himself now as a self-made man who began life with what he has characterized as a meager $1 million advance from his father. That figure itself represents a significant understatement about the support his father provided him over the years. But in his darkest moment, Mr. Trump again leaned on his family\u2019s wealth, this time to ride out a financial tsunami.\n\nThe \u201cfinancial tsunami\u201d was caused by Trump\u2019s bad decision-making, over-borrowing, miscalculating the future of high-interest junk bonds, overextending himself with extravagant purchases, mismanaging his businesses which were losing money, and a financial recession.\n\nBy 1991, he barely had enough cash to keep up with his personal monthly expenses. So he turned to his dad.\n\nHe promised to make up for a cash shortfall with the sale of condominium units in Trump Tower in Manhattan. When that did not generate enough money, he filled the hole in his balance sheet with the \u201cunforecasted receipt of funds from certain family-owned properties in New York City\u201d \u2014 apparently referring to fees from properties his father, Fred C. Trump, had built outside Manhattan. At the end of 1990, when Mr. Trump was facing an $18.4 million interest payment, his father sent a lawyer to the Castle casino to buy $3.3 million in chips and leave without cashing them, providing his son with an infusion of cash.\n\nAs BuzzFeed\u2019s Andrew Kaczynski reported in 2015, that \u201cloan\u201d prompted an investigation from the Division of Gaming Enforcement, who \u201cultimately found the loan to be illegal. In the end, Trump got to keep the money but had to pay a $30,000 fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cSweeney said Fred Trump also agreed to apply for a license as a financial source, which would make another such loan possible in June, when the next interest payment is due,\u201d a Philadelphia Inquirer story from the time read. Fred Trump would make further payments to his son, and Donald Trump ultimately settled his debts\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

  "Just when the people of the Middle East thought things couldn\u2019t get any worse, Donald J. Trump is elected president of the United States. Now, their apprehension about the president-elect dwarfs their disappointment with President Obama.\n\nIt could be a blessing in disguise.\n\nAmerica, in one magic moment, you\u2019ve revealed how you\u2019ve changed. For the worse. Poor you, you feel so insecure, vulnerable and fragile. Like the rest of us.\n\nSo, instead of reaching for your famed \u201ccan-do\u201d spirit, lifting yourselves up by the bootstraps, you turned to a strident, bellicose type of nationalism. The kind usually associated with strutting generalissimos of Third World nations with their chests covered with made-up, self-awarded medals.\n\nMaybe the people of the Middle East will look and realize that you are no longer the Great Democracy to emulate. That your modern style of empire and your role as keeper of the world order for the world\u2019s own good are stumbling and failing, even in your own eyes; and that we in the Middle East should not be turning to you for rescue.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, you\u2019ve been on a self-assigned mission to change the Middle East. Indeed, the world. Now, it seems as if the change has flowed the other way.\n\nYou\u2019ve voted to reduce your liberties. To narrow the range of people entitled to justice and equality before the law. To live in a place where the police should not be criticized; where fighting political correctness is more important than fighting racism; where Muslims are suspected and people who appear Hispanic can be rounded up if they\u2019re not carrying their papers.\n\nIn this election you\u2019ve revealed that your people \u2014 like Russians, Hungarians, Iraqis, Iranians and others whose politics you normally look down on \u2014 will choose a narrow, nonsensical nationalist ethos when they feel threatened by uncertainty. Your imperial outreach allowed you to experience other cultures, but now you\u2019ve chosen to shrink your outlook, with the expectation that the world will continue to revolve around you\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

  "You have had experiences of outreach and cultural exchange, but have now chosen to focus inward and expect the world to continue revolving around you. This shift in perspective may cause you to miss out on new experiences and perspectives.\nPrevious Question \nQuestion:Why do you think a shift in perspective towards inwardness may cause someone to miss out on new experiences and perspectives?\nAnswer:How can a shift towards inwardness potentially limit one's exposure to new experiences and perspectives?\n\n When someone chooses to focus inward and expects the world to revolve around them, there is a risk of becoming closed off to the diversity of experiences and perspectives that exist outside of their own. By turning inward, they may inadvertently isolate themselves from opportunities for cultural exchange and outreach. This self-centered perspective can lead to a lack of curiosity about the world around them, inhibiting personal growth and understanding.\n\nEngaging in outreach and cultural exchange allows individuals to broaden their horizons, challenge preconceived notions, and gain fresh insights into different cultures, ideas, and ways of life. It encourages empathy, tolerance, and an appreciation for diversity. By actively seeking out new experiences and perspectives through outreach, individuals have the opportunity to expand their knowledge, develop new skills, foster meaningful connections with others, and contribute positively to society.\n\nHowever, when one shifts their focus solely inward and expects the world to revolve around them, they may unintentionally limit themselves to their own familiar bubble. This insular mindset can hinder personal growth by restricting exposure to different viewpoints or challenging situations that can stimulate intellectual curiosity and broaden one's understanding of the world.\n\nIn essence, while it is important to take care of oneself and prioritize personal well-being at times, it is equally crucial not to become so self-absorbed that we miss out on valuable opportunities for growth through engagement with others. Balancing introspection with outward exploration allows for a more comprehensive understanding of ourselves as well as the world we inhabit.\n\nAsk a single relevant and insightful question about the preceding context and previous questions.

Teams typically try to maintain possession in order to create opportunities to score goals or advance the ball towards their opponents' goal. Possession can be measured in various ways, such as the percentage of time a team has the ball, the number of passes made during a game, or the distance that the ball travels during a game. A team that is able to maintain possession for extended periods of time may create a sense of control and momentum on the field. However, teams also need to be aware of their opponents' tactics and strategies in order to prevent them from regaining possession.\n\nQuestion:Q: What are some ways in which a team can regain possession of the ball in football?\nOriginal text: Teams regain possession of the ball in football by preventing the opposing team from maintaining control, and may do so by intercepting passes, tackling players, or forcing the opposing team to make mistakes.\nParaphrased version: Football teams can reclaim the ball by disrupting the opposing team's control and executing tactics such as intercepting passes, tackling players, or causing the other team to make mistakes.\nAnswer the question step by step and explain your thoughts.

  "\n\\section{Proof of Proposition 2.1}\n\nLet $h_i=a_ie^{j\\theta_i}$, $g_i=b_ie^{j\\psi_i}$ be the polar form representation of $h_i$ and $g_i$, respectively. Note that $a_i$ and $b_i$ are i.i.d. Rayleigh random variables with scale parameter $\\nu=1$. Thus, one could rewrite Eq. \\ref{eq:y} as follows:\n\\begin{align}\ny=\\sqrt{p_t\\zeta}\\sum_{i=1}^Na_ib_ie^{j(\\phi_i+\\theta_i+\\psi_i)}x + w\n\\end{align}\nRecall from assumption A3 that the IRS controller has perfect CSI of both hops at its disposal, it employs transmit beamforming mechanism which leads to zero phase error at the UE. In other words, the IRS controller sets the phase of its $i$-th element as follows: $\\phi_i=-\\theta_i-\\psi_i$. Thus, the SNR at the UE becomes:\n\\begin{align}\n\\gamma=\\frac{p_t\\zeta\\vert \\sum_{i=1}^Na_ib_i\\vert^2}{\\sigma^2}=\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{p_t\\zeta} \\sum_{i=1}^N(a_ib_i)}{\\sigma}\\right)^2\n\\end{align}\n\nLet $A_i=\\frac{\\sqrt{p_t\\zeta}}{\\sigma}a_ib_i$, then $E(A_i)=\\frac{\\sqrt{p_t\\zeta}\\pi}{2\\sigma }$ and $V(A_i)=\\frac{p_t \\zeta(16-\\pi^2)}{4\\sigma^2}$. For $N$ reasonablly large, one could invoke the Central Limit Theorem to get the following result: $\\sum_{i=1}^NA_i\\sim \\mathcal{N}(N(\\frac{\\sqrt{p_t \\zeta}\\pi}{2\\sigma }),N(\\frac{p_t \\zeta(16-\\pi^2)}{4\\sigma^2}))$. Finally,\n\\begin{align}\n\\gamma=N\\frac{p_t \\zeta(16-\\pi^2)}{4\\sigma^2}\\chi_1^2(\\lambda).\n\\end{align}\n\n\\section{Proof of Proposition 2.2}\nTo derive the distribution of the SNR for the IRS-assisted MISO downlink, we begin by assuming $N=2$ and $N_t=2$. This allows us to write the following equation:\n\\begin{align}\n\\label{eq:app21}\n\\mathbf{g}^H\\mathbf{\\Pi}\\mathbf{Hf}=\\pi_1g_1(f_1h_{11}+f_2h_{12})+\\pi_2g_2(f_1h_{21}+f_2h_{22})\n\\end{align}\nwhere $\\pi_i=e^{j\\phi_i}$. We design the reflection coefficients matrix $\\mathbf{\\Pi}$ at the IRS as follows: $\\mathbf{\\Pi} = diag[\\mathbf{\\frac{g}{||g||^2}}]$. Thus, $\\mathbf{g}^H\\mathbf{\\Pi} = [1, \\, 1]$. In plain words, we have designed $\\mathbf{\\Pi}$ such that the IRS does transmit beamforming on the second hop (which effectively cancels out the effects of the channels on the second hop). Therefore, we could re-write Eq. \\ref{eq:app21} as follows:\n\\begin{align}\n\\label{eq:app22}\n\\mathbf{g}^H\\mathbf{\\Pi}\\mathbf{Hf}=(f_1h_{11}+f_2h_{12})+(f_1h_{21}+f_2h_{22})\n\\end{align}\n\nLet $\\mathcal{A}=(f_1h_{11}+f_2h_{12})$, and $\\mathcal{B}=(f_1h_{21}+f_2h_{22})$. Then, one could verify that $\\mathcal{A} \\sim C\\mathcal{N}(0,\\vert f_1\\vert^2+\\vert f_2\\vert^2)$, and that $\\mathcal{B} \\sim C\\mathcal{N}(0,\\vert f_1\\vert^2+\\vert f_2\\vert^2)$.

  "\\section{Horrocks data bundles on ACM Varieties}\r\n Let $X$ be a smooth ACM variety of dimension $n$ in $\\mathbb P^{n+r}$ over a field $k$.  For any sheaf $\\sB$ on $X$, $H^i_*(\\sB)$ will denote\r\n $\\oplus_{l\\in \\mathbb Z}H^i(X, \\sB(l))$.  The coordinate ring of $X$, $A=H^0_*(\\O{X})$, is a noetherian Cohen-Macaulay graded\r\n $k$-algebra. $H^i_*(\\sB)$ is a graded module\r\n over $A$. Let \\textbf{M} be the\r\n category of graded, finitely generated $A$-modules and graded homomorphisms. Any finitely generated projective graded\r\n $A$ module  has the form $\\oplus_i A(a_i)$ for some shifts $a_i\\in \\mathbb Z$ in grading, and will be called a free\r\n $A$-module.\r\n Let $\\mathfrak P \\subset\r\n \\textbf{M}$ be the full subcategory of finitely generated free $A$-modules.\r\n $\\mathcal C^-(\\textbf M)$ (respectively $\\mathcal C^-(\\mathfrak P)$) will denote the category of all complexes, bounded above,\r\n of objects in $\\textbf M$ (resp. $\\mathfrak P$), where morphisms are  maps between two complexes.\r\n Since \\textbf{M} has enough projectives, given a complex $C^\\centerdot$ of objects in \\textbf{M}, bounded above,\r\n one can find a free resolution:\r\n\\textit{ie.} a complex $P^\\centerdot$ in $\\mathcal C^-(\\mathfrak P)$ with a quasi-isomorphism $P^\\centerdot \\to C^\\centerdot$.\r\n\r\nLet $\\sE \\in \\textbf{VB}$ be an object in the category of vector bundles of finite rank on $X$. $H^i_*(\\sE)$ is an $A$-module\r\nof finite length for $1\\leq i\\leq n-1$. A vector\r\nbundle will be called free if it has the form $\\oplus_i \\sO_X(a_i)$.  A vector bundle $\\sE$ will be\r\ncalled ACM (arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay) if $H^i_*(\\sE)=0$ for all $1\\leq i\\leq n-1$. Since $X$ is ACM, every free bundle is\r\nACM. By Serre duality, the line bundle $\\omega_X$ is an ACM line bundle.\r\n\r\nGiven $\\sE$, let $E$ denote the graded $A$-module $H^0_*(\\sE) $. Denoting duals by $^\\vee$ in the categories \\textbf{VB} and\r\n\\textbf{M}, we have $H^0_*(\\sE^\\vee) \\cong (H^0_*(\\sE))^\\vee $.\r\nFollowing Horrocks, we choose a resolution of $H^0_*(\\sE^\\vee)$ by finitely generated free modules:\r\n\\begin{equation}\\label{Ho1} \\dots \\to C^{3\\vee} \\to C^{2\\vee} \\to C^{1\\vee} \\to C^{0\\vee} \\to H^0_*(\\sE^\\vee)\r\n\\to 0.\\end{equation} In \\cite{Ho}, this could be chosen as a finite resolution, but in our case, it may be infinite. However,\r\nif $K = \\ker(C^{n-2\\vee} \\to C^{n-3\\vee})$, then $\\sK$ is an ACM vector bundle on $X$ where $\\sK=\\tilde K$ is the sheaf obtained\r\nfrom $K$.\r\nReplacing the terms up to and including $C^{n-1\\vee}$ by $K$ and dualizing, we get the complex,\r\n\r\n\\begin{equation}\\label{Ho2} C^{\\centerdot}_{\\{0,n\\}}:  0 \\to C^0 \\xrightarrow {\\delta^1_{C^\\centerdot}} C^1 \\xrightarrow\r\n{\\delta^2_{C^\\centerdot}} C^2 \\xrightarrow {\\delta^3_{C^\\centerdot}} \\dots\\xrightarrow {\\delta^{n-2}_{C^\\centerdot}} C^{n-2}\\to\r\nK^\\vee \\to 0.\\end{equation}\r\n\r\nThe exact sequence (\\ref{Ho1}), when sheafified, gives an exact sequence of vector bundles, and its  dual gives the exact\r\nsequence of vector bundles\r\n\\begin{equation}\\label{Ho3} 0 \\to \\sE \\to \\tilde C^0 \\xrightarrow {\\delta^1_{C^\\centerdot}} \\tilde C^1 \\xrightarrow\r\n{\\delta^2_{C^\\centerdot}} \\tilde C^2 \\xrightarrow {\\delta^3_{C^\\centerdot}} \\dots\\xrightarrow {\\delta^{n-2}_{C^\\centerdot}}\r\n\\tilde C^{n-2}\\to \\sK^{\\vee} \\to 0.\\end{equation}\r\n\r\nFrom this it becomes evident that $E = H^0_*(\\sE)$ is given as $H^0(C^\\centerdot_{\\{0,n\\}})$, and $ H^i_*(\\sE)=\r\nH^i(C^\\centerdot_{\\{0,n\\}})$ for $i=1,\\dots n-1$ (where $C_{\\{0,n\\}}^{n-1}$ is understood to refer to $K^\\vee$).\r\n\r\n$E$ itself has a free resolution (again possible infinite). Splice $ C^\\centerdot_{\\{0,n\\}}$ with a  free resolution\r\n$L^\\centerdot$ of $E$ and call the resulting complex $C^\\centerdot$\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

  "Seattle Police released dashcam video and audio of the fatal shooting of Charleena Lyles in Magnuson Park. Officers can be heard shouting \u201cGet back! Get back!\u201d before gunfire breaks out. Also, details from a June 5 call to her home bear striking similarity to Sunday\u2019s incident.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Seattle police responded to a domestic-violence call at the home of 30-year-old Charleena Lyles.\n\nDuring the encounter, police say Lyles armed herself with a pair of shears and threatened officers. Although the officers reported that they feared for their safety, they were able to talk a distraught Lyles into dropping the shears.\n\nThe June 5 call is strikingly similar to Sunday\u2019s incident at Lyles\u2019 Magnuson Park apartment, which ended with the mother of four being shot to death by two officers. Police say Lyles was armed with two knives, according to a newly released transcript of audio of the shooting.\n\nFamily members are angry that officers used deadly force when police concede that the two responding officers had \u201cless lethal-force options\u201d at their disposal, although the department has confirmed that neither was carrying a Taser.\n\nLyles had been struggling with mental-health issues for the past year and was concerned that authorities would take her children, one of whom they said has Down syndrome, her family said.\n\nBoth of the officers involved had undergone Crisis Intervention Training (CIT) and one was a certified CIT officer, meaning he had undergone additional intensive de-escalation and mental-health intervention training, Police Chief Kathleen O\u2019Toole said Monday.\n\nLyles\u2019 family said Sunday that the shooting could have been avoided and that they believe race \u2014 she was African American \u2014 was a factor. The officers who shot Lyles are white, police said.\n\n\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t they have Tased her? They could have taken her down. I could have taken her down,\u201d said Monika Williams, Lyles\u2019 sister.\n\nO\u2019Toole said Monday neither officer was armed with a Taser. SPD officers are given the option of carrying a Taser, pepper spray or a baton as a less-then-lethal option.\n\n\u201cThe message I\u2019m trying to get out right now is that this is a horrible tragedy all around,\u201d O\u2019Toole said. \u201cThe community is distraught. The family is distraught. The officers are distraught.\u201d\n\nThe names of the police officers who shot Lyles have not been released.\n\nO\u2019Toole promised the department\u2019s investigation into the shooting would be transparent and \u201cthat we\u2019ll go where the truth takes us\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 4 sentences.

It\ngeneralizes a previously proposed technique\n\\cite{tsai_correction_2009,luna_compensation_2006,\n  agazzi_90_2008}. Current and emerging digital receivers for ultra\nhigh-speed communication systems~\\cite{morero_design_2016,\n  faruk_digital_2017, crivelli_architecture_2014, palermo_cmos_2016,\n  ethernet_alliance_2020_2020, brandolini_5_2015,xu_5-bit_2016}\nrequire large bandwidth, high sampling rate Analog-to-Digital\nConverters (ADCs).\n\nThe TI-ADC~\\cite{laperle_advances_2014,kull_cmos_2016} has been the\ntechnique predominantly used to meet the demanding sampling rate and\nbandwidth requirements of high-speed transceivers.\n\nThe performance of TI-ADCs is affected by mismatches among the\ninterleaves~\\cite{kurosawa_explicit_2001,vogel_impact_2005}. Mismatches\nof sampling time, gain, bandwidth, as well as DC offset, are the most\ncommon impairments. Many calibration techniques have been proposed in\nthe literature. Please see \\cite{wei_8_2014, song_10-b_2017,\n  mafi_digital_2017, guo_16-gss_2020, lee_1_2014,\n  saleem_adaptive_2010, matsuno_all-digital_2013,\n  harpe_oversampled_2014, ali_12-b_2020, reyes_joint_2012,\n  reyes_design_2017, le_duc_fully_2017, guo_5_2020,\n  salib_high-precision_2019,\n  murmann_digitally_2013,harpe_digitally_2015} and references therein\nfor a thorough review and discussion.\n\nCalibration techniques for general purpose TI-ADCs in general require\ndedicated calibration blocks and algorithms. On the other hand,\nseveral authors \\cite{ luna_compensation_2006, tsai_correction_2009,\n  agazzi_90_2008} have shown that in the special case of an equalized\ndigital receiver, it is possible to treat the TI-ADC errors as\nintegral part of the communication channel and take advantage of the\nalready existing adaptive equalizer to compensate them. Therefore\ncalibration becomes an integral part of the channel equalization. No\nspecial purpose analog or digital calibration blocks or algorithms are\nrequired.  Equalizer-based compensation can compensate static as well\nas frequency-dependent errors such as bandwidth limitations and\nbandwidth or frequency response mismatches among the interleaves of\nthe ADC. Because the equalizer is adaptive, it also compensates\ntime-dependent effects such as those caused by temperature and voltage\nvariations, or by aging. Therefore, equalization becomes the TI-ADC\ncompensation technique of choice in digital communication receivers\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

  "\\section{Introduction}\n\nTermination of higher-order term rewriting\nsystems~\\cite[Chapter~11]{Terese2003} has been an active area of\nresearch for several decades.\nOne powerful method, introduced by v.d. Pol \\cite{Pol1993,pol:96},\ninterprets terms into \\emph{weakly monotonic algebras}.  In later work\n\\cite{FuhsKop2012,Kop2012}, these algebra interpretations are specialised\ninto \\emph{higher-order polynomial interpretations}, a generalisation of\nthe popular -- and highly automatable -- technique of polynomial\ninterpretations for first-order term rewriting.\n\nThe methods of weakly monotonic algebras and polynomial\ninterpretation are both limited to \\emph{monomorphic} systems.\nIn this paper, we will further generalise polynomial\ninterpretations to a higher-order formalism with full impredicative\npolymorphism.\nThis goes beyond shallow (rank-1, weak) polymorphism,\nwhere type quantifiers are effectively allowed only at the top of a\ntype: it would be relatively easy to extend the methods to a system\nwith shallow polymorphism since shallowly polymorphic rules can be seen as defining an\ninfinite set of monomorphic rules.\nWhile shallow polymorphism often suffices\nin functional programming practice, there do exist interesting\nexamples of rewrite systems which require higher-rank impredicative\npolymorphism.\n\nFor instance, in recent extensions of Haskell one may define a type of\nheterogeneous lists.\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n  \\mathtt{List} : * &\n  \\mathtt{foldl}_\\sigma(f,a,\\mathtt{nil}) \\longrightarrow a \\\\\n  \\mathtt{nil} : \\mathtt{List} &\n  \\mathtt{foldl}_\\sigma(f,a,\\mathtt{cons}_\\tau(x,l)) \\longrightarrow \\mathtt{foldl}_\\sigma(f,f \\tau a x,l) \\\\\n  \\mathtt{cons} : \\forall \\alpha . \\alpha \\rightarrow \\mathtt{List} \\rightarrow \\mathtt{List} \\quad\\quad \\\\\n  \\multicolumn{2}{l}{\\mathtt{foldl} : \\forall \\beta . (\\forall \\alpha . \\beta \\rightarrow \\alpha \\rightarrow \\beta) \\rightarrow \\beta \\rightarrow \\mathtt{List} \\rightarrow \\beta}\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nThe above states that $\\mathtt{List}$ is a type ($*$), gives the types of its\ntwo constructors $\\mathtt{nil}$ and $\\mathtt{cons}$, and defines the corresponding\nfold-left function~$\\mathtt{foldl}$. Each element of a heterogeneous\nlist may have a different type. In practice, one would\n  constrain the type variable~$\\alpha$\n  with a type class to\n  guarantee the existence of some operations on list elements.  The\nfunction argument of~$\\mathtt{foldl}$ receives the element together\nwith its type. The $\\forall$-quantifier binds type variables: a term\nof type $\\forall \\alpha . \\tau$ takes a type~$\\rho$ as an argument and\nthe result is a term of type~$\\tau[\\subst{\\alpha}{\\rho}]$.\n\nImpredicativity of polymorphism means that the type itself may be\nsubstituted for its own type variable, e\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

  "\\section{Introduction}\nDetermining effective equations of motion of a complex interacting system is a classic problem in Statistical Mechanics \\cite{stratonovich_topics_1963, miguel1980colored, haenggi_colored_1995, gardiner_stochastic_2009, pavliotis_stochastic_2014}.\nA typical scenario of this kind is encountered when a colloidal particle is immersed in a rapidly fluctuating medium. \nWhen there exists a clear separation between time scales, the fast degrees of freedom (medium) can be integrated out and subsumed into a reduced set of equations of motion for the slow degrees of freedom (particle).\nSeveral schemes have been proposed in the past to achieve this goal, generally starting form a set of (stochastic) differential equations which are phenomenologically assumed to describe the coupled system composed by the particle and its bath.\nMost of these schemes are based on the operator projector formalism \\cite{mori_contraction_1980, morita_contraction_1980, zwanzig_non-equilibrium_2001, teVrugt_2020} or on the eigenfunction expansion of the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the original set of Langevin equations \\cite{kaneko_adiabatic_1981, theiss_systematic_1985, theiss_remarks_1985, risken_fokker-planck_1989}.\n\nThe case in which the tracer particle moves in a correlated medium, which displays long-range correlations and large relaxation times, has recently received renewed attention \\cite{demery_drag_2010, dean_diffusion_2011, demery_thermal_2011, demery_perturbative_2011, demery_diffusion_2013, fujitani_fluctuation_2016, Fujitani_2017, gross_dynamics_2021, Venturelli_2022, Basu_2022, Venturelli_2022_2parts}.\nIndeed, this paradigm is relevant to describe, \\textit{e.g.}, the dynamics of inclusions in lipid membranes \\cite{reister_lateral_2005, reister-gottfried_diffusing_2010, camley_contributions_2012, camley_fluctuating_2014, Stumpf_2021}, microemulsions \\cite{Gompper_1994,Hennes_1996,Gonnella_1997,Gonnella_1998}, as well as defects in ferromagnetic systems \\cite{demery_drag_2010, demery_perturbative_2011}.\nMoreover, recent advances in experimental technology have made it possible to measure the critical Casimir forces acting on colloidal particles immersed in near-critical fluid media \\cite{hertlein_direct_2008,gambassi_critical_2009,magazzu_controlling_2019}. The properties of these forces, which are the classical thermal counterpart of the celebrated Casimir force in electromagnetism \\cite{casimir_attraction_1948}, are relatively well understood in equilibrium \\cite{krech_casimir_1994,kardar_friction_1999,brankov_theory_2000,gambassi_casimir_2009,maciolek_collective_2018,Dantchev_2022}, while much remains to be unveiled about their \\textit{non-equilibrium} properties. Simple toy models have thus been devised in order to investigate the coupled out of equilibrium dynamics of one or a few particles in contact with near-critical media \\cite{demery_drag_2010, demery_perturbative_2011, dean_diffusion_2011, zakine_spatial_2020, gross_dynamics_2021, Venturelli_2022, Basu_2022}. \nTheoretical descriptions of this type of systems often feature a scalar order parameter (OP) $\\phi(\\bv{r})$, which may represent the relative concentration of the two species in a binary liquid mixture, or else the deviation of the local fluid density from its critical value in a single-component fluid (\\textit{i.e.}, $\\phi(\\bv{r})\\propto n-n_c$). A velocity field $\\bv{v} (\\bv{r},t)$ should be included to allow for the hydrodynamic transport of the OP field and the particle, but we will neglect it here for simplicity \\cite{hohenberg_theory_1977}. A possible enhancement or suppression of the OP field or its correlations at the tracer location $\\bv{R}(t)$ (representing, e.g., critical adsorption \\cite{diehl_field-theoretical_1986}) can be modeled by including in the free energy terms proportional to $\\phi(\\bv{R})$ or $\\phi^2(\\bv{R})$, respectively, or derivatives thereof \\cite{demery_thermal_2011}.\n\nIn order to obtain the effective dynamics of the tracer, a systematic method for the elimination of the field degrees of freedom coupled to $\\bv{R} (t)$ from the dynamics is required -- particularly in the case in which the field relaxation is \\textit{fast} (compared to the scale of the particle diffusion), but not instantaneous. The problem of the elimination of $N$ (non-interacting) fast variables from a system of $N+M$ stochastic differential equations is of course not new. \nThe eigenfunction expansion method \\cite{kaneko_adiabatic_1981,theiss_systematic_1985,theiss_remarks_1985} has been successfully applied to the case in which the field-particle coupling is linear, both in a confined geometry \\cite{naji_hybrid_2009,gross_dynamics_2021} and in the continuum \\cite{Venturelli_2022}. In this setting, the fast variables correspond to the Fourier modes of the field, while the $d$-dimensional coordinates of the particle are the slow variables.\nThe case of a quadratic coupling has hitherto not been addressed within the above formalism: notably, its underlying working hypothesis that the $N$ fast variables are non-interacting is generally violated, because the coupling to the particle can introduce interactions between the Fourier modes of the field. Other methods \\cite{gardiner_adiabatic_1984, gardiner_stochastic_2009} require the specification of a steady-state distribution around which to construct a perturbative series in small powers of an appropriate adiabaticity parameter $\\chi$; however, such steady-state distribution is not necessarily known \\textit{a priori} when the system is out of equilibrium.\n\nIn this paper we present an adiabatic elimination method for a tracer particle with generic (linear or quadratic) couplings to a stochastic background field in confinement. The method consists in a systematic expansion in powers of a small \\textit{adiabaticity} parameter $\\chi$, which encodes the ratio of the field relaxation timescale to that of the particle diffusion. The procedure is transparent as it is based on a multiple-time-scale (or Chapman-Enskog-like) approach, where we project the dynamics over the \\textit{moments} of the joint probability distribution $P(\\bv{R},\\phi,t)$: this way we obtain a hierarchy of equations for the various moments, which can be truncated by noting that the higher moments relax faster than the lower ones \\cite{Cates_2013,Solon_2015, Vishen_2018}.\nNotably, no assumption is made \\textit{a priori} about the equilibrium distribution of the tracer particle: the steady-state distribution is instead obtained from the method itself, the outcome of which is an effective Fokker-Planck (FP) equation for the tracer position $\\bv{R} (t)$. In fact, our method can be applied to systems violating detailed balance between tracer and field degrees of freedom\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

  "\\section{Introduction} \r\n\r\nLet $G$ be any finite simple graph with vertex set $V(G) = \\{x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\}$\r\nand edge set $E(G)$, where simple means no loops or\r\nmultiple edges.\r\nThe \\textbf{edge ideal} of $G$ is the ideal\r\n$I(G)=\r\n\\left\\langle  x_{i}x_{j} \\mid \\{x_{i},x_{j} \\}\\in E(G) \\right\\rangle$\r\nin the polynomial ring $R = k[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]$ ($k$ is any field).\r\nDescribing the\r\ndictionary between the graph theoretic properties of $G$\r\nand the algebraic properties of $I(G)$ or $R/I(G)$ is an \r\nactive area of research, e.g., see\r\n\\cite{MV,V}.\r\n\r\nRelating the homological\r\ninvariants of $I(G)$ and the graph theoretic invariants of $G$\r\nhas proven to be a fruitful approach to building this\r\ndictionary.  Recall that the  \r\n\\textbf{minimal graded free resolution} of $I(G) \\subseteq R$\r\nis a long exact sequence of the form\r\n\\[\r\n0 \\rightarrow \\bigoplus_{j} R(-j)^{\\beta_{l,j}(I(G))} \r\n\\rightarrow   \\bigoplus_{j} R(-j)^{\\beta_{l-1,j}(I(G))} \\rightarrow \\cdots \r\n\\rightarrow   \\bigoplus_{j} R(-j)^{\\beta_{0,j}(I(G))} \\rightarrow \r\nI(G) \\rightarrow 0\r\n\\]\r\nwhere $l \\leq n$ and $R(-j)$ is the free $R$-module obtained by shifting \r\nthe degrees of $R$ by $j$ (i.e., $R(-j)_a = R_{a-j}$). \r\nThe number $\\beta_{i,j}(I(G))$, the $i,j$-th \r\n\\textbf{graded Betti number} of $I(G)$, equals the number of\r\nminimal generators of degree $j$ in the $i$-th syzygy module of \r\n$I(G)$.  Two invariants that measure the ``size''\r\nof the resolution are the \\textbf{(Castelnuovo-Mumford) regularity}\r\nand the \\textbf{projective\r\ndimension}, defined as\r\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\r\n{\\rm reg}(I(G)) & = & \\max\\{ j-i \\mid \\beta_{i,j}(I(G))\\neq 0 \\}, ~~\\mbox{and}~~\\\\\r\n{\\rm pd}(I(G))  & = & \\max\\{ i \\mid \\beta_{i,j}(I(G))\\neq 0 ~~\\mbox{for some $j$}\\}.\r\n\\end{eqnarray*}\r\nOne wishes to relate the numbers $\\beta_{i,j}(I(G))$ to the\r\ninvariants of $G$; e.g., see the survey of H\\`a \\cite{Ha} which focuses\r\non describing ${\\rm reg}(I(G))$ in terms of the invariants of $G$.\r\n\r\nIn this note we give explicit formulas for ${\\rm reg}(I(G))$ for the\r\nedge ideals of two infinite families of circulant graphs.\r\nOur results complement previous work on the algebraic and\r\ncombinatorial topological properties of circulant\r\ngraphs (e.g, \\cite{EVMVT,M,Ri,RiRo,RR,R,VMVTW}).\r\nFix an integer $n \\geq 1$ and a subset $S \\subseteq \\{1,\\ldots,\\lfloor\r\n\\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor \\}$.  The \\textbf{circulant graph}\r\n$C_n(S)$ is the graph on the vertex set $\\{x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}\\}$\r\nsuch that $\\{x_i,x_j\\} \\in E(C_n(S))$ if and only if \r\n$|i-j|$ or $n-|i-j| \\in S$. To simplify notation, we write $C_n(a_1,\\ldots,a_t)$ instead of\r\n$C_n(\\{a_1,\\ldots,a_t\\})$. As an example, the graph $C_{10}(1,3)$ is drawn\r\nin Figure \\ref{circulantex}.\r\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\r\n\\Circulant{10}{1,3} \r\n\\caption{The circulant $C_{10}(1,3)$}\\label{circulantex}\r\n\\end{figure}\r\n\r\nWhen $S = \\{1,\\ldots,\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor\\}$, then\r\n$C_n(S) \\cong K_n$, the clique on $n$ vertices.\r\nOn the other hand, if $S = \\{1\\}$,\r\nthen $C_n(1) \\cong C_n$, the cycle on $n$ vertices\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 7 sentences.

  "One year into his term, the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan pledged his vision for a 24hr city, launching a set of ten principles that pave the way for the capital to develop its night time economy, competing with the likes of Berlin, Tokyo and New York.\n\nThe principles, focused primarily on promoting cultural, leisure, retail and nightlife activities for all Londoners, rely on an accessible and safe transport network.\n\nToday, London\u2019s \u00a326bn night time economy generates one in eight jobs in the city and the opportunity is set to grow by a further \u00a32bn each year by 2030. The Night Tube, in particular, is projected to bring in \u00a377m per year by 2029.\n\n\u201cWe are moving forward as a truly 24hr global capital,\u201d said Amy Lam\u00e9, London\u2019s first ever Night Czar, in her keynote speech at UCL Transport Institute\u2019s Night Moves event, a symposium focused on better understanding the challenges of night time transportation. \u201cWe can do this safely, we can do it sustainably and I would make the argument that transport is absolutely key to this.\u201d\n\nWhen the Night Tube was launched in August 2016, it was expected to be an instant hit with night revellers, but with 8.9 million journeys registered in the first 14 months, its popularity has far exceeded expectations.\n\nCrime levels have stayed low despite initial fears of anti-social behaviour, and the Night Tube has now been embraced as a success.\n\nHowever, gaps in policy and data mean that certain vulnerable categories of passengers, such as women and young men, can still feel unsafe when travelling at night.\n\nBusting the myths\n\nWeeks ahead of the Night Tube\u2019s launch date, fears of an increase in crime and anti-social behaviour flooded the headlines.\n\nA report by the London Assembly\u2019s Police and Crime Committee published at the time warned that sexual offences and other crimes were likely to increase with the introduction of the Night Tube, while Transport for London (TfL) predicted \u201chigh crime levels\u201d and a \u201crowdy environment\u201d. A list of \u2018red stations\u2019 believed to be at particular risk of such incidents was published, which included Camden Town, London Bridge, North Greenwich, Vauxhall, Brixton, Waterloo and Oxford Circus.\n\nA year has now passed and the numbers paint a very different picture.\n\n\u201cOn average, there are 11 crimes recorded on Night Tube services each weekend,\u201d a TfL spokesperson says. \u201cThat\u2019s against the backdrop of around 160,000 journeys, so the crime levels of the Night Tube are low and they account for about 5% of total crime recorded by the British Transport Police (BTP) for London Underground services.\n\n\u201cCrime levels have stayed low despite initial fears of anti-social behaviour.\u201d\n\n\u201cTfL takes customer safety really seriously and we work alongside the police to make sure that both day and night tube services run smoothly and that customers feel like it\u2019s a safe environment.\u201d\n\nThe stations open through the night are staffed at all times, while 100 additional dedicated Night Tube BTP officers patrol the grounds, providing a high-visibility police presence.\n\nCampaigns such as Report It to Stop It, which encouraged passengers to call a dedicated number if they suffer from or witness a case of sexual assault, and National Hate Crime Awareness Week have also been positive forces in fighting and reducing crime. According to TfL, the numbers of reports and arrests have increased since the Report It to Stop It campaign was launched.\n\n\u201cThis tells us a story about myth-busting,\u201d Lam\u00e9 said, arguing that the public narrative around the night time economy needs to change.\n\n\u201c[NTE] is not just about night time entertainment. It\u2019s also about people working in essential services,\u201d she said.\n\nMore data needed to increase safety\n\nBut, as safe as London is now, it can be even safer, especially for women. Between 2011 and 2016, there was a 15% increase in women working night shifts in industries such as care working and nursing, meaning that women now account for more than two-thirds (69%) of the growth in night-working over the past five years\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 7 sentences.

  "The text states that women now make up more than two-thirds (69%) of the growth in night-working in industries such as care working and nursing.\n\nQuestion:Why are women predominantly occupying night-working roles in industries like care working and nursing?\n\n Women are increasingly dominating the growth in night-working roles in industries such as care working and nursing due to several factors. Firstly, caregiving roles have traditionally been associated with women, as they are often seen as more nurturing and empathetic. This societal expectation has led to a higher representation of women in these fields overall.\n\nAdditionally, the rise in night-working positions can be attributed to the increasing demand for 24/7 healthcare services. As the population ages and healthcare needs expand, there is a greater need for round-the-clock care, leading to an increase in night-shift positions. Women, who already make up a significant portion of the healthcare workforce, are naturally drawn to these opportunities.\n\nFurthermore, practical considerations also play a role. Night shifts often provide more flexibility for women who may have other responsibilities during the day, such as childcare or household duties. The ability to work at night allows them to balance their personal obligations while still pursuing their careers.\n\nOverall, a combination of societal expectations, increasing demand for 24/7 care services, and the flexibility offered by night shifts has contributed to women making up a significant portion of the growth in night-working roles in industries like care working and nursing.\nAnswer the question step by step and explain your thoughts.

  "The text states that women now make up more than two-thirds (69%) of the growth in night-working in industries such as care working and nursing.\nPrevious Question \nQuestion:Why are women predominantly occupying night-working roles in industries like care working and nursing?\n\n Women are increasingly dominating the growth in night-working roles in industries such as care working and nursing due to several factors. Firstly, caregiving roles have traditionally been associated with women, as they are often seen as more nurturing and empathetic. This societal expectation has led to a higher representation of women in these fields overall.\n\nAdditionally, the rise in night-working positions can be attributed to the increasing demand for 24/7 healthcare services. As the population ages and healthcare needs expand, there is a greater need for round-the-clock care, leading to an increase in night-shift positions. Women, who already make up a significant portion of the healthcare workforce, are naturally drawn to these opportunities.\n\nFurthermore, practical considerations also play a role. Night shifts often provide more flexibility for women who may have other responsibilities during the day, such as childcare or household duties. The ability to work at night allows them to balance their personal obligations while still pursuing their careers.\n\nOverall, a combination of societal expectations, increasing demand for 24/7 care services, and the flexibility offered by night shifts has contributed to women making up a significant portion of the growth in night-working roles in industries like care working and nursing.\nAnswer:What factors contribute to the growing number of women taking on night-shifting jobs in the healthcare industry?\n\n Factors contributing to the growing number of women occupying night-shifting jobs in the healthcare industry include traditional associations with caregiving, the need for 24/7 healthcare services, and increased flexibility due to night shifts allowing women to balance personal responsibilities alongside career development.\nQuestion:What specific aspects of the workplace culture and policies do you think could be improved to better support women in their careers, particularly those with family responsibilities?\nAnswer:How can organizations in the healthcare industry promote gender equality and support women with family responsibilities in their careers?\n\n Organizations in the healthcare industry can promote gender equality and support women with family responsibilities by implementing various measures. Firstly, they can create policies that provide flexible work arrangements, such as part-time options, job-sharing, or remote work opportunities. This flexibility allows women to balance their career aspirations with their family obligations.\n\nSecondly, organizations can offer comprehensive parental leave policies that include both maternity and paternity leave. By providing equal opportunities for men to take time off for caregiving responsibilities, it helps reduce the burden on women and promotes a more equitable division of household duties.\n\nThirdly, fostering a supportive and inclusive workplace culture is crucial. Organizations should actively promote diversity and inclusion initiatives, provide mentorship programs for women, and establish employee resource groups that focus on gender-related issues.

The Mold Culture Collection (MCC) at the University of Nottingham holds over 250 strains of Penicillium spp. and over 100 strains of Aspergillus spp. with potential applications in various fields, including medicine, food, and industrial processes.\nAnswer:Step 1: Identify the Key Points\nRead the text and identify the key points mentioned in the passage. The key points in the text are:\n* Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in 1928\n* Penicillin is a substance made from mold that can cure bacterial infections\n* Penicillin changed the world of medicine by saving millions of lives\n* The Mold Culture Collection at the University of\nQuestion:Sure, here's a question based on the previous context and questions: \"Can you explain the significance of Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin and how it changed the world of medicine?\"\nAnswer:Of course, I'd be happy to help!\nStep 1: Alexander Fleming's Discovery\nIn 1928, Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming made a groundbreaking discovery in his laboratory at St. Mary's Hospital in London. He had been working on a culture of bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, when he noticed something peculiar. One of his bacterial cultures had been contaminated with a mold, Penicillium notatum, which had formed a visible growth on the agar plate. To his surprise, the area around the mold was clear of bacteria.\nStep 2: Isolation and Identification\nFleming isolated the mold and grew it in a pure culture. He then identified it as Penicillium notatum and began to study its properties. He found that the mold produced a substance that\nQuestion:One relevant and insightful question about the preceding context and previous questions could be: \"What was the impact of penicillin's discovery on the medical field?\"\nAnswer:Of course!\nStep 1: Revolutionary Impact\nThe discovery of penicillin had a revolutionary impact on the medical field. Prior to its discovery, bacterial infections were often deadly, and doctors had limited treatment options. Penicillin changed all that, as it was a powerful antibiotic that could effectively treat a wide range of bacterial infections.\nStep 2: Saving Lives\nPenicillin was first used in humans in the 1940s and quickly became a widely used and effective treatment for bacterial infections. Its use saved countless lives and significantly reduced the number of deaths from infections.\nStep 3: Changes in Medical Practice\nPenicillin's discovery also changed the way doctors practiced medicine. With a powerful antibiotic available, doctors were able to treat infections more effectively and focus on other aspects of healthcare.\nStep 4: Antibiotic Resistance\nHowever, the widespread use of penicillin also led to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which pose a significant threat to public health today. As a result, doctors must use antibiotics judiciously and only when necessary to prevent the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\nOverall, the discovery of penicillin was a significant breakthrough in the medical field, saving countless lives and changing the way doctors practice medicine.\n\nQuestion:In 1928, Alexander Fleming was working in his laboratory at St. Mary's Hospital in London when he stumbled upon a\nAnswer the question step by step and explain your thoughts.

As the complexity of tasks and the number of agents grow, the coordination abilities of agents become of fundamental importance. Humans excel at large-group coordination, and language clearly plays a central role in their problem solving ability \\cite{Tomasello:2010,DavidBarrett:Dunbar:2016,Lupyan:Bergen:2016}. This insight is inspiring algorithmic innovations in multi-agent learning, where communication is used to facilitate coordination among multiple agents interacting in complex environments. While many ingredients of the experiments we review in this section are shared with those we discussed above, now our emphasis is not on the nature of the emergent language, but on whether its presence will aid multi-agent communities to achieve better coordination. Consequently, we focus on setups going beyond referential games, looking at what communication brings in terms of ``added value'' when it is not simply a goal in itself.\n\nPre-deep-learning work on multi-agent communication for coordination\n\\cite{Panait:Luke:2005} used to hard-code communication, e.g., by directly\nsharing sensory observations or information concerning the current\nstate of agents or their policies\n\\cite{Tan:1993}.\nReinforcement learning provides a mechanism for learning communication\nprotocols, lifting many assumptions required by hand-coded\nprotocols \\cite{Kasai:etal:2008}. \\citeA{Foerster:etal:2016}  combined reinforcement\nlearning and deep networks in the context of developing communication\nprotocols for interacting agents, presenting experiments with both\ndiscrete and continuous communication (the RIAL and DIAL systems briefly discussed in Section \\ref{sec:discrete-continuous} above). The study found that allowing agents to communicate improves coordination, as indicated by\nhigher team rewards compared to no-communication controls. However,\nwhile continuous communication systematically results in improved\ncoordination \\cite<see also>{Sukhbaatar:etal:2016,Kim:etal:2019,Singh:etal:2019},\ndiscrete communication does not yield consistent improvements when the\ncomplexity of the environment grows, and it only manages to marginally improve\non the baselines when the agents are constrained to share the same\nweight parameters, a rather unrealistic assumption.\n\n\nLearning with a discrete channel is more challenging due to the joint exploration problem, i.e., the environment non-stationarity introduced by the fact that all agents are learning  simultaneously and independently.  In an attempt to facilitate learning with a discrete channel, \\citeA{Lowe:etal:2017}  allowed centralized training but decentralized execution. Specifically, the authors modified the standard actor-critic approach from reinforcement learning \\cite{Sutton:Barto:1998}, under which an agent's own observation and action are used by an agent-specific ``critic'' to produce an estimate of the value of the action. In \\citeA{Lowe:etal:2017}, the critic was shared by all agents,  thus allowing them to receive, at training time only, extra information about the other agents' policies, without access to their internal states.  \n\nIn the already discussed study of \\citeA{Mordatch:Abbeel:2018}, agents are placed in an environment in\nwhich they can use non-verbal means of communication, i\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 4 sentences.

It provides feedback on the quality of the agent's decisions, guiding it towards actions that lead to higher rewards and away from actions that result in penalties.\nParaphrased: The reward signal plays a crucial role in reinforcement learning by signaling to the agent whether its actions are leading to desirable outcomes.

Agents can learn the most effective protocols through trial and error, leading to more flexible and efficient communication strategies.\n2. This allows agents to adapt their communication based on the dynamic nature of the environment and interactions with other agents.\n3. By learning from experience, agents can develop more effective communication strategies that optimize their performance, rather than relying on predefined behaviors.\n4. This flexibility and efficiency can lead to better decision-making, problem-solving, and overall coordination among agents.\n5. Overall, the ability of agents to learn and adapt their communication strategies through trial and error empowers them to navigate complex environments and interact with other agents in a more effective and adaptive manner.\nQuestion:Could you expand on what you mean by \"complex environments\" in the context of artificial intelligence? Are you referring to physical spaces or more abstract domains such as social networks or financial systems?\nAnswer:Q: Could you clarify what \"hand-coded protocols\" are in the context of artificial intelligence?\nParaphrased: \"Hand-coded protocols\" refer to communication protocols that are manually created or programmed by humans, often requiring a great deal of expertise and knowledge to devise. In the context of artificial intelligence, these protocols are typically predefined and not adaptable to changes in the environment or interactions with other agents.\nQuestion:Q: How does reinforcement learning differ from supervised or unsupervised learning?\nA: Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that involves an agent learning from its environment by taking actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. Supervised learning involves learning from labeled training data, while unsupervised learning involves finding patterns in unlabeled data. Reinforcement learning differs from these in that it focuses on learning through trial and error, with the goal of maximizing a cumulative reward signal over time.\nAnswer:Q: What is the purpose of a reward signal in reinforcement learning?\nA: The reward signal in reinforcement learning serves as a mechanism for the agent to learn from its actions and adjust its behavior accordingly. It provides feedback on the quality of the agent's decisions, guiding it towards actions that lead to higher rewards and away from actions that result in penalties.\nParaphrased: The reward signal plays a crucial role in reinforcement learning by signaling to the agent whether its actions are leading to desirable outcomes. This feedback allows the agent to modify its behavior and make decisions that will maximize its cumulative reward over time.\n\nQuestion:The key takeaways from the text are:\n1. Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.\n2. The goal of reinforcement learning is to maximize the cumulative reward that the agent receives over time.\n3. The agent learns from its experiences and uses that knowledge to modify its behavior in order to make decisions that will lead to desirable outcomes.\n4. The feedback provided to the agent in the form of rewards or penalties allows it to learn and adapt its behavior to maximize its cumulative reward over time.\nAnswer the question step by step and explain your thoughts.

  "\n\n\n\\section{Introduction and summary}\n\nThe two-derivative tree-level effective action of bosonic string theory has been extensively used for cosmological applications: it is the starting point of what is \nsometimes called ``tree-level string cosmology'' \\cite{Antoniadis:1988aa,Antoniadis:1988vi,Antoniadis:1990uu,Veneziano:1991ek,Tseytlin:1991xk,Tseytlin:1991ss,Tseytlin:1992ye,Tseytlin:1992jq,Gasperini:1992em,Tseytlin:1994cd,Copeland:1994vi,Easther:1995ba}, which exploits the presence of a tree-level cosmological constant in noncritical dimensions. \nIn the present paper we go beyond tree level  (in the string coupling) and calculate the bosonic string  one-loop three- and four-point amplitudes  to quadradic order in momentum. \nTo our knowledge these results have not appeared before in the literature. \nFrom that, we are then able to extract the \none-loop low-energy two-derivative effective action $\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{eff}}$ for the massless fields.  \n\n\nBy definition, $\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{eff}}$ is an action in target space whose tree-level amplitudes reproduce the full one-loop string theory amplitude for the massless fields: the graviton, the antisymmetric two-form  and the dilaton, and can thus be read off systematically from the string theory amplitude.  \nWhile the construction of the effective action is in principle straightforward (albeit technically involved) for the superstring,  \nthere are two additional complications which arise in the case of  the bosonic string:  the nonvanishing dilaton tadpole (which is generally present in nonsupersymmetric string models), and the tachyon.\n\n\n\n\nAs is well known, the presence of the tachyon in the spectrum signals an instability of the vacuum. We do not offer a way to circumvent this problem: as in most of the literature on \nthe subject (see however \\cite{Tseytlin:1991bu}) we will  \nconcentrate on the massless fields alone, simply ignoring the tachyonic couplings in the effective action. \nAn additional issue with the tachyon is that it gives an infinite contribution to the one-loop vacuum energy, resulting in an infinite cosmological term. The way we \ndeal with this here is to simply renormalize by hand the value of the one-loop vacuum energy to a finite value $\\Lambda$, which we will treat as a tunable parameter of the bosonic string model.\\footnote{A numerical estimate for $\\Lambda$, obtained by removing the divergent tachyon contribution in $D=26$, is given in appendix \\ref{app:numest}; it depends crucially on the \n ratio of gravitational (Planck) to string length.} On the other hand, there are numerous  tachyon-free string theory models which are non-supersymmetric and therefore are expected to generally develop \na cosmological constant at one loop. Our methods are readily transferable to the study of these, potentially more realistic, models. \n\n\n\nThe dilaton tadpole reflects the fact that one is expanding around the wrong vacuum. \nIt is related to the appearance of a non-vanishing cosmological constant  at one-loop order in the string coupling --which is otherwise a desirable feature with regards to  \npotential cosmological applications.  \nIn the presence of tadpoles momentum-independent infinities arise in the two types of  amplitudes depicted in figs.~\\ref{urfig1},~\\ref{urfig2}. (These are one-loop diagrams, but the argument can be generalized to arbitrary  order in the coupling expansion)\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

  "\\section{Introduction\\label{sec:intro}}\n\n\nThe Standard Model provides an elegant and successful explanation to the electroweak and strong interactions in nature \\cite{Patrignani:2016xqp}. However, there are many open problems that require physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) to take place. A common particle in these models beyond the SM is a neutral gauge boson, usually referred to as $Z^\\prime$. Such gauge bosons arise naturally in Abelian gauge groups or in gauge groups that embed an Abelian symmetry. The mass of this boson can be generated in several ways, for instance via spontaneous symmetry breaking of a \nscalar which is singlet or doublet under the SM group, each case leading to very different phenomenology \\cite{Carena:2004xs}. \nThe mass and interaction strength of $Z'$ bosons with SM particles are very model dependent and entitled to a rich phenomenology from low to high energy scales \\cite{Langacker:2008yv,Langacker:2000ju}. Phenomenological studies have been conducted, among others, in the context of colliders \\cite{Dittmar:2003ir,Basso:2008iv,Fox:2011qd,Alves:2013tqa,Arcadi:2013qia,Cline:2014dwa,deSimone:2014pda,Buchmueller:2014yoa,Ducu:2015fda,Alves:2015mua,Chala:2015ama,Okada:2016gsh,Accomando:2016sge,Alikhanov:2017cpy}, electroweak precision \\cite{Erler:2009jh,Martinez:2014lta}, flavor physics \\cite{CarcamoHernandez:2005ka,Gauld:2013qba,Buras:2013qja} or neutrinoless double beta decay \\cite{Lindner:2016lpp}. \n\nAnother particle often present in a multitude of beyond the Standard Model frameworks is the dark photon. Dark photons are typically defined as light vector bosons that possess small kinetic mixing with the QED field strength tensor \\cite{Fayet:2004bw,Bouchiat:2004sp,Pospelov:2007mp,Pospelov:2008zw}. They are supposed to be much lighter than $90$~GeV, the mass of the $Z$ boson. Such particles have also been subject of intense searches at low energy colliders and accelerators \\cite{Agakishiev:2013fwl,Adlarson:2013eza,Yu:2013aca,Gninenko:2013rka,Lees:2014xha,Arias:2014ela,Curtin:2014cca,TheBelle:2015mwa,Batley:2015lha,Banerjee:2016tad,Aguilar-Arevalo:2016zop,Barello:2016zlb,Angloher:2016rji,He:2017ord,Biswas:2017lyg,Ablikim:2017aab,Aaij:2017rft,He:2017zzr,Lees:2017lec}. \nWe emphasize that when we refer to the $Z^\\prime$ mass  in our work, we mean the gauge boson mass in a general way, because the $Z^\\prime$ can take the form of a dark photon-like boson.  The main difference between these two bosons is the type of interactions they feature with the SM particles. If the kinetic mixing with the QED field strength tensor was the only new term, then the dark photon would only have vectorial interactions with quarks and charged leptons and none whatsoever with the SM neutrinos. In complete dark photon-like models, however, there should be an underlying new broken gauge symmetry, under which SM particles possibly have non-zero charges. Therefore, there could be a mass mixing term in addition to the kinetic mixing, and we arrive again at the classical  notion of a $Z'$ boson. \nFor historical reason, $Z^\\prime$ models and dark photon models are usually described in different contexts but \nthey simply refer to a massive gauge boson coming from a new gauge symmetry. Therefore, in what follows, we will use the terms $Z^\\prime$ and dark photon interchangeably.  \\\\\n\n\nPhenomenological studies in the context of $Z^\\prime$ or dark photon models in a general setup should include the presence of both mass and kinetic mixing between the vector bosons in the theory. \nIn this work, we provide a general formalism to treat these models. In what regards phenomenology, we will be focused primarily on neutrino-electron scattering process \\cite{Steiner:1970ux,Reines:1970pm,Gurr:1972pk,Wheater:1982yk,Dorenbosch:1988is,Fukuda:1998ua,Bahcall:1995mm,Auerbach:2001wg} since both $Z^\\prime$ as well as dark photon-like models give rise to sizable new physics contributions, allowing us to place restrictive constraints. \n\\\\\n\nThe observation of neutrino-electron scattering has proven to be an amazing laboratory to test the SM and probe new physics effects motivating a multitude of studies \\cite{Miranda:1995qc,Barranco:2007ej,Bolanos:2008km,Garces:2011aa,Billard:2014yka,Bertuzzo:2017tuf,Rodejohann:2017vup,Kouzakov:2017rvz}.  In particular, precise measurements of the neutrino-electron scattering have furnished relevant bounds on $Z^\\prime$ bosons for specific models based on the baryon minus lepton number ($B-L$) \\cite{Harnik:2012ni}, $L_{\\mu}-L_{\\tau}$ symmetries \\cite{Kaneta:2016uyt,Chen:2017cic,Araki:2017wyg} and dark photon-like models \\cite{Bilmis:2015lja,Ge:2017mcq}. In the future, \nmore measurements will be coming up, see e.g.\\ Refs.\\ \\cite{Kyberd:2012iz,Bian:2017axs}. \nMotivated by the popularity of $Z^\\prime$ and dark photon models in the literature and the relevance of neutrino-electron scattering constraints for light dark species we build here up a general setting where constraints using data from neutrino-electron scattering can be placed on $Z^\\prime$ and dark photon models in the presence of mass  and kinetic mixing terms\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 4 sentences.

Essentially, the $U(1)_X$ symmetry is the key to understanding how the $Z'$ boson acquires mass.\n\nQuestion:How does the existence of a new gauge symmetry like $U(1)_X$ impact the current understanding of the Higgs mechanism and the generation of mass in the Standard Model of particle physics?\nAnswer the question step by step and explain your thoughts.

  "Thanks to western sanctions and the Kremlin\u2019s bans on foreign imports, Russia\u2019s economic prospects look gloomy. In September, inflation reached a three-year peak, and could exceed 8 percent by the end of the year. Sliding crude oil prices, growth stagnation, capital flight, and the recent devaluation of Russia's sovereign debt to the second-lowest investment-grade rating leave little room for optimism. The current climate will ultimately increase social instability\u2014indeed, it is already showing signs of doing so. And despite the arrogant speech Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered at the Valdai Discussion Club, an invite-only gathering of prominent journalists and policymakers held in Sochi last week, he has real reasons to worry.\n\nIt\u2019s trivial to point out that Russia, ranking 127 out of 177 countries in Transparency International Corruption Perception Index, is an extremely corrupt country (in fact, TI estimates likely understate the reality). Putin\u2019s kleptocratic system, brilliantly described by Karen Dawisha in a new book (which Cambridge University Press refused to publish earlier this year), has redistributed hydrocarbon profits in exchange to both the so-called core elites (people from the closest pro-Putin circles) and mass constituencies (through pay increases for public sector employees who constitute about 70% of Russia\u2019s middle class, ISRAS estimates) in exchange for unquestioned loyalty. As various kleptocratic schemes evolved under Putin\u2019s rule in the last decade, Russia has fallen about 50 places on the CPI index.\n\nPutin\u2019s main problem is that the system he built up is almost entirely based on material reimbursement. Personalistic regimes like the one he has built sustain the loyalty of their supporters almost entirely through access to material rewards, and they are extremely vulnerable to economic catastrophe. Unlike other political systems, neopatrimonial states have no alternative methods of ensuring support. In institutionalized autocratic systems like China, loyalty can be exchanged for partial power-sharing; in ideological systems like the USSR, moral commitment to ideological values and ideals may sustain elite loyalty. But in a political system built on corruption, the redistribution of capital is the primary method of getting and keeping political support.\n\nFor most of the previous decade, the Kremlin enjoyed a continuously expanding economy and increasing resource inflows; Putin had no problem buying the loyalty of the elites while maintaining the support of the Russian populace. So long as the economy was soaring, average Russians remained loyal to the authorities. But things started to change as early as 2011, when Boris Nemtsov, a Russian opposition leader, remarked, \u201cEveryone is unhappy with Putin, save perhaps his closest friends\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 7 sentences.

  "By Tom Bevan - November 27, 2013\n\nThe botched rollout of Barack Obama's signature health care law continues to take a political toll on the president. The latest evidence is a Quinnipiac University survey released Wednesday morning showing the president's approval rating hitting a record low of 34 percent in Ohio. Obama's disapproval rating has jumped to an all-time high of 61 percent. This represents a significant decline from Quinnipiac's last poll in Ohio on June 26, when Obama recorded a 40 percent approval rating and a 57 percent disapproval rating.\n\nThe president's personal credibility has also taken a serious hit, thanks to his broken pledge that Americans would be able to keep their health care plans. Only 39 percent of Ohioans now believe the president is \"honest and trustworthy,\" a new low, while 57 percent believe he is not \"honest and trustworthy,\" a new high.\n\nThe law itself has also suffered in the eyes of the public. Only 35 percent of Ohioans currently support Obamacare, while 59 percent are opposed.\n\nAnd the bumpy rollout of Obamacare appears to have shaken the public's faith in the government's ability to manage and deliver health care services. Only 16 percent of those surveyed expressed the belief that the quality of health care they would receive one year from now would be better because of Obamacare. Nearly three times that many people (45 percent) said the quality of health care would be worse a year from now. Thirty-five percent said the law would make no difference in health care quality.\n\nThe Quinnipiac University survey was conducted from Nov. 19-24 among 1,361 registered voters in Ohio with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.7 percentage points\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 6 sentences.

  "I have received the following e-mail from Alex Kozinski\u2019s wife:\n\nMr. Frey:\n\nMy name is Marcy Tiffany. I have been married to Alex Kozinski for over thirty years and we have raised three sons together. First, let me thank you for making the effort to discover the truth about what happened, and for giving me an opportunity to respond to the stories that have been circulating about Alex.\n\nTurning to the facts of the matter, the LA Times story, authored by Scott Glover, is riddled with half-truths, gross mischaracterizations and outright lies. One significant mischaracterization is that Alex was maintaining some kind of \u201cwebsite\u201d to which he posted pornographic material.\n\nObviously, Glover\u2019s use of the word \u201cwebsite\u201d was intended to convey a false image of a carefully designed and maintained graphical interface, with text, pictures, sound and hyperlinks, such as businesses maintain or that individuals can set up on Facebook, rather than a bunch of random files located in one of many folders stored on our family\u2019s file server. The \u201cserver\u201d is actually just another home computer that sits next to my desk in our home office, and that we use to store files, perform back-ups, and route the Internet to the family network. It has no graphical interface, but if you know the precise location of a file, you can access it either from one of the home computers or remotely.\n\nUsing the term \u201cwebsite\u201d also gives the impression that Alex was actively aware of all of the material, when, in fact, it had accumulated over a number of years and he didn\u2019t even remember that some of that stuff had been stored there or whether it had been put there by him or one of our sons, who also have access to the server.\n\nGlover also wrote that \u201cthe sexually explicit material on the site was extensive.\u201d In fact, of the several hundred items in the \u201cstuff\u201d folder, the vast majority was cute, amusing, and not in the least bit sexual in nature. For example, there\u2019s a program that lets you build a snowman (no private parts involved). There\u2019s a \u201cstress reliever\u201d that lets you take a virtual hammer to your desktop (which I\u2019ve been using a lot lately). There\u2019s a picture of freshly painted double-yellow lines that go right over road kill, with the caption \u201cnot my job award.\u201d There\u2019s something called \u201ccool juggle\u201d that shows a video of a guy juggling who drops a ball outside the frame and becomes a stick figure when he goes to pick it up. There are over 300 individual items in the \u201cstuff\u201d folder, the vast majority of which are of this nature. In addition, this folder contains about a half-dozen items that, while humorous, also have some kind of sexual aspect. Most of these you have already identified on your website.\n\nI would note that in addition to the \u201cstuff\u201d folder, which Alex and my sons used to store a hodge-podge of miscellaneous humorous items, we use to the server to store several dozen other folders that contain a lot of personal material. For example, there is a folder that has copies of papers my kids have written in school. There is another folder that has family photos. There is a folder that has copies of articles that Alex has written. Obviously, the advantage of using a server is so that we can access the material from other computers and also send family members and friends links that will allow them to see a specific item in a folder\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

  "\\section{Introduction}\nIn the most general statement, single-machine scheduling\nis to process a set $J$ of tasks non-preemptively on a single machine.\nEach task $j\\!\\in\\! J$  is ready for processing at time zero \nand has a processing time $p_j$, \nthat is neither time-dependent nor sequence-dependent\n(w.l.o.g. we assume that $p_j \\!\\geqslant\\!1$).\n\nA schedule can be then encoded by\nthe vector of its completion times $(C_j)_{j\\in J}$.\nSuch an encoding allows to express\na wide range of criteria,\nparticularly the so called regular criteria,\nwhich are decreasing functions of $C_j$ for each task $j$.\nUsing these continuous variables,\nQueyranne~\\cite{Queyranne} provided useful polyhedral tools \nfor minimizing one of the most studied regular criteria: \n$\\sum \\omega_j C_j$.\nTo the best of our knowledge,\nthe scheduling literature lacks from \nsimilar results for non-regular criteria.\nThe contribution of this work falls within this scope.\nOur focus is on minimizing a non-regular criterion\noccurring in just-in-time scheduling.\n\n\nWe consider a single machine scheduling problem where\nall tasks share a common due date $d$. \nA task $j\\!\\in\\! J$ is early (resp. tardy) \nif  $C_j\\!\\leq\\! d$ (resp.  $C_j\\!>\\! d$).\nUsing $[x]^+$  to denote the positive part of $x \\!\\in\\! \\mathbb{R}$,\nthe earliness (resp. tardiness) of any task $j\\!\\in\\! J$ \nis given by $[d\\!-\\!C_j]^+$ (resp. $[C_j\\!-\\!d]^+$).\nGiven unitary earliness penalties $(\\alpha_j)_{j\\in J}$ \n(resp. tardiness penalties $(\\beta_j)_{j\\in J}$),\nthe problem aims at finding a schedule \nthat minimizes the total penalty defined as:\n$$\nf_{\\alpha,\\beta}(C) = \\sum\\limits_{j\\in J} \\alpha_j[d\\!-\\!C_j]^+ +\\beta_j[C_j\\!- \\!d]^+\n$$\nWhen $d \\!\\geqslant\\! \\sum p_j$, \nthe common due date is called \\imp{unrestrictive} \nsince the due date does not restrict \nthe total duration of early tasks \\cite{Hall_et_Posner}.\nIn this case, \nthe so-called V-shaped dominance property~\\cite{Hall_et_Posner}\nensures that there exists \nan optimal solution such that early tasks are scheduled \nby increasing ratio $\\alpha_j/p_j$ \nwhile tardy tasks are scheduled \nby decreasing ratio $\\beta_j/p_j$. \nIn addition, according to some strong dominance properties~\\cite{Hall_et_Posner}, \nthere exists an optimal schedule without idle time\nand with an \\imp{on-time} task, \\textit{i.e\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 7 sentences.

Ah, hello fellow senators, it is good to see you all again! I\u2019ve recently been to the Pandidakterion\u2019s Psychology Department, and they\u2019ve told me (you can read the note here\u2013Michael passes around a letter signed by the Chair of the Psychology Department) that such outbreaks as what occurred at our last session are rare occurrences and should decrease in frequency and intensity with time. They have declared me sane enough to carry out my duties to the state effectively. Now on to the pressing matters. There has been a small rebellion in Wales. You may or may not have heard about it, most likely because the Ministry of Security detected it early and dispatched a couple legions to the area to defeat them before they could do any serious damage. You all know the 1891 communist rebellion that was crushed. I witnessed it personally. They besieged my estates in Jerusalem and Damascus, the latter of which was burned down. I was in Jerusalem at the time, and I saw how the people were angry to the point of rebellion. They must be granted social reforms to alleviate their suffering. But political reforms, I fear, would likely make the situation worse. And then the communists rose up in 1894\u2026we need a change we can believe in, and fast!

Senator Michael acknowledges recent rebellions in Wales and communist uprisings, highlighting the importance of social reforms while expressing caution about political changes. He also mentions the potential benefits of tractors and dismisses the Germanic invention of flying machines. Lastly, he discusses remnants of Konstantinos's Rebellion and their defeat across various regions. \n\n How can the empire balance social reforms with political stability during times of rebellion?\n The empire can implement targeted social reforms to address the people's grievances while maintaining a firm stance on political stability. This could involve improving living conditions, providing economic opportunities, and addressing specific concerns raised by rebellious factions.

  "Last year marked the return of one of the greatest games ever made and yes, I know this is supposed to be an article about Skyri\u2026 I mean, Twin Peaks but bear with me because this is absolutely crucial to the article as a whole.\n\nWhere was I? Oh yeah, what is the greatest game ever made? Doom of course and 2016 marked our return to Hell with the release of a fresh take on the old and classic Doom by id Software. Whereas the latest Doom paid homage to literally everything that made the original Doom\u2019 Doom there was another entry in this franchise that completely fucked it up and I\u2019m talking about the 2005 movie; Doom. Starring The Rock and Karl Urban, Doom (2005) lacked one basic requirement and that is fucking Demons from Hell!!\n\nYeah, \u201cDemons\u201d\u2026 like, the name of\u2026 this particular episode of Twin Peaks\u2026 see, I told you it was totally crucial to this article. I guess you think that I totally wasted those 139 words but you know what? My article. Deal with it.\n\nThe question is; are there any demons in this episode and without giving too much away, yeah. In the non-Doom sense of the word?! There aren\u2019t any big pink shaved gorillas with massive horns and they don\u2019t make camel orgasm sounds when killed, nope we\u2019re talking about the classic definition of the word; \u201cDemon\u201d. One, that inhabits a host to do their bidding\u2026 and it\u2019s this episode where we\u2019re formally introduced to Mike.\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will host a month-long series of screenings of classic horror films with \u201cUniversal\u2019s Legacy of Horror\u201d in October. The series is part of the studio\u2019s year-long 100th anniversary celebration engaging Universal\u2019s fans and all movie lovers in the art of moviemaking. Pictured: David Naughton in AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, 1981.\n\nThe episode begins where we last left off. Harold Smith is going crazy with a small little garden tool. He\u2019s slashed his face in front of Donna and Maddy and it seems he\u2019s about to attack them both when James bursts in and rescues these two dumbasses.\n\nDonna drops Laura\u2019s Secret Diary and yet again her stupid agenda has been foiled! Maybe give up on being a detective, Donna, it suits you as much as your crappy meals on wheels gillet from a few episodes ago!\n\nAs Donna and James have a little hug in front Maddy, Harold escapes into his orchid sanctuary and starts watering his flowers\u2026 then he nearly goes \u201cfull on David Kessler\u201d and howls at the moon. Creedence Clearwater Revival starts playing and he convulses in abject agony, suddenly his hands become rubber prosthetics and his entire body sprouts fur\u2026 actually this doesn\u2019t happen but it almost does. Harold Smith actor\u2019 Lenny von Dohlen does howl as if he were transforming into a lycanthrope and we all know that if he were to, then he\u2019d gain no benefits from sleeping\u2026 well, by Skyrim logic anyway!\n\nSo while Harold turns into his \u201cFinal Form\u201d (registered trademark of Toei Animation and Akira Toriyama) we\u2019re treated to the left overs of the opening sequence. I guess they wanted to build mood? Anyway, we watch the last of the credits and then finally Cooper returns Audrey to Twin Peaks.\n\nThey\u2019ve taken refuge in the Bookhouse and Cooper puts her to bed because heroin overdoses usually require a decent night\u2019s sleep in order fully get out of your system\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

  "In his book, In Two Minds: The Dilemma of Doubt & How to Resolve It, theologian Os Guinness wrote, \u201cIf ours is an examined faith, we should be unafraid to doubt. If doubt is eventually justified, we were believing what clearly was not worth believing. But if doubt is answered, our faith has grown stronger. It knows God more certainly and it can enjoy God more deeply.\u201d\n\nIn other words, no matter how strong our faith is, at some point we may experience doubt. But instead of being a sign of weakness, doubt can actually be something that causes us to dig deeper into our relationship with God, and can even make our faith stronger.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some prominent Christian thinkers, leaders and ministers who all wrote about struggles with doubt, faith and finding God through it all.\n\nC.S. Lewis\n\nOne of modern Christianity\u2019s most beloved authors and thinkers, Lewis is remembered for classics including Mere Christianity, The Chronicles of Narnia and The Screwtape Letters. But the renowned defender of the faith is also known for a more complicated side, famously writing, \u201cI have found that nothing is more dangerous to one\u2019s own faith than the work of an apologist.\u201d\n\nEven with all of his contributions to contemporary Christianity, Lewis led a somewhat controversial personal life, and at times wrestled with the intellectual side of faith.\n\nLewis warned readers of the hazards of relying on intellect\u2014particularly apologetics\u2014over spirituality, writing, \u201cThat is why we apologists take our lives in our hands and can be saved only by falling back continually from the web of our own arguments, as from our intellectual counters, into the Reality \u2014 from Christian apologetics into Christ Himself. That also is why we need another\u2019s continual help\u2014a [\u2018Let us pray for each other\u2019]. There\u2019s also a famous story of a critic getting the best of Lewis during a debate centering on one of the chapters in his book Miracles, and the distress it caused.\n\nBut despite intellectual challenges, issues in his personal life and emotional swings, Lewis is ultimately remembered for his writings on faith: Even when it meant putting aside momentary feelings of uncertainty: \u201cFaith, in the sense in which I am here using the word, is the art of holding on to things your reason has once accepted, in spite of your changing moods \u2026 That is why Faith is such a necessary virtue: unless you teach your moods \u2018where they get off,\u2019 you can never be either a sound Christian or even a sound atheist.\u201d\n\nMother Teresa\n\nToday, Mother Teresa of Calcutta is primarily remembered for her selfless service to the poor and sick, but a book of letters printed after her death revealed that even she struggled with doubt at times.\n\nThe letters showed a different woman than the symbol of Christian love and unwavering faith that much of the media portrayed her as. She frequently wrote of loneliness, not hearing from God, personal hypocrisy and doubts about her own faith: \u201cDarkness is such that I really do not see\u2014neither with my mind nor with my reason\u2014the place of God in my soul is blank\u2014There is no God in me\u2014when the pain of longing is so great\u2014I just long & long for God \u2026 The torture and pain I can\u2019t explain.\u201d\n\nShe frequently asked privately for prayers, writing \u201cSuch deep longing for God\u2014and \u2026 repulsed\u2014empty\u2014no faith\u2014no love\u2014no zeal. (Saving) souls holds no attraction\u2014Heaven means nothing\u2014pray for me please that I keep smiling at Him in spite of everything.\u201d\n\nShe wrote to a friend, \u201cI spoke as if my very heart was in love with God\u2014tender, personal love. If you were (there), you would have said, \u2018What hypocrisy.'\u201d\n\nBut, even though she experienced chapters of loneliness and feelings of isolation from God, her devotion to her calling never wavered, and today she\u2019s remembered for her love of the poor and heeding of Christ\u2019s command to care for them\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

  "Prominent Christian thinkers such as C.S. Lewis and Mother Teresa struggled with doubt despite their faith. Intellectual challenges, personal issues, and emotional swings can test one's beliefs. But, these figures showed that true faith requires acknowledging and working through periods of uncertainty. Even amid questions and confusion, they remained devoted to their calling. Their examples demonstrate that doubt need not weaken our faith but rather strengthen it. It encourages us to dig deeper into our relationship with God.\n\n How can we distinguish between moments of genuine spiritual searching and intellectual\n\nQuestion:How can we distinguish between moments of genuine spiritual searching and intellectual doubt?\n\n Distinguishing between moments of genuine spiritual searching and intellectual doubt can be challenging, but there are a few key factors to consider. Genuine spiritual searching often stems from a deep desire for truth, meaning, and connection with a higher power. It involves seeking answers to existential questions and a willingness to explore different perspectives. On the other hand, intellectual doubt tends to arise from questioning specific religious doctrines or philosophical ideas. It is rooted in rational inquiry and the need for logical coherence.\n\nTo differentiate between the two, it is important to reflect on the underlying motivations behind our doubts or searches. Are we genuinely seeking a deeper understanding of our faith and its implications? Or are we primarily focused on resolving intellectual conflicts or satisfying our curiosity? Additionally, examining the emotional aspect is crucial. Spiritual searching often involves an emotional longing for spiritual fulfillment, while intellectual doubt may lead to feelings of confusion or skepticism.\n\nUltimately, distinguishing between genuine spiritual searching and intellectual doubt requires introspection and self-awareness. By honestly evaluating our intentions, emotions, and the driving forces behind our inquiries, we can gain clarity about whether we are engaging in a sincere pursuit of truth or simply grappling with intellectual challenges.\nAnswer the question step by step and explain your thoughts.

  "\\section{Introduction}\n    In speech communication people make use of two types of information to convey their intentions: \\textit{what} is said (linguistic information) and \\textit{how} it is said (paralinguistic information) \\cite{mitra2019leveraging}. Paralinguistic information is expressed by suprasegmental features such as duration, intensity and pitch. Even with the same linguistic information, changes in these prosodic features can communicate different implications. One such implication involves emphasis. As the terminology can be ambiguous, we follow Kohler's \\cite{kohler2006emphasis} distinctions of two kinds of emphasis: \\textit{emphasis for focus}; which `singles out elements of discourse by making them more salient than others'; and \\textit{emphasis for intensity}; which `intensifies the meaning contained in the elements.' The current work addresses the first category of emphasis: focus. In the literature of a semantic framework called Alternative Semantics \\cite{rooth1985association, rooth1992theory}, focus is understood as the indication of `the presence of alternatives that are relevant for the interpretation of linguistic expressions' \\cite{krifka2008basic}. Consider this example:\n    \n        \\begin{enumerate}[label=(\\arabic*)]\n            \\item \\begin{enumerate}[label=\\alph*.]\n                      \\item \\label{emotive_a} \\textbf{John} bought the apple.\n                      \\item \\label{emotive_b} John \\textbf{bought} the apple.\n                  \\end{enumerate}\n        \\end{enumerate}\n        \n    \\noindent In (1a), \\textit{John} is focused, as indicated by bold typeface. The speaker implies that \\textit{It was John who bought the apple}, indicating the presence of contextually possible alternatives such as \\textit{Peter} or \\textit{Mary}, and at the same time indirectly ruling out these agents for the person who \\textit{bought the apple}. In contrast, in (1b), focus falls on \\textit{bought}, by which the speaker indicates that \\textit{What John did was not sell the apple, but buy the apple}. Although (1a) and (1b) give identical linguistic information, the differences in the focused words create different connotations. In English speech, focus is marked by sentence stress, the most prominent stress within a sentence \\cite{wells2006english}\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 4 sentences.

What does it say in a short summary?\nThe paper introduces a machine learning model that allows to predict how relevant a news article will be to a user based on the text content of that article, as well as metadata associated with both the article and the user. 2. Why is this interesting or important? This approach has potential benefits in domains such as personalized news recommendation systems, advertising targeting, or even automated journalism. 3. How was it done? What methods were used? The authors describe a feed-forward neural network architecture that uses convolutional layers and max pooling operations to extract high-level features from the input articles, and then uses fully connected layers to combine these features into a single prediction score. The model is trained on a dataset of real-world news articles, and performance is evaluated using two different evaluation metrics. 4. Are there limitations or caveats? What could be improved? Although the experimental results show promising initial performance, the model still has some room for improvement, especially when it comes to capturing nuances in the text content and accounting for contextual factors. Also, the training dataset may have biases or coverage issues that could affect generalization. 5. What are the implications? What are the possible applications or future research directions?

Here are some potential consequences:\n\n1. Understanding confinement: Scalar glueballs are made up entirely of gluons, which carry the strong force responsible for binding quarks together inside protons and neutrons. Therefore, studying these particles can help us understand how the strong force works at distances comparable to the size of nucleons (protons and neutrons). This information is crucial for understanding the phenomenon of confinement, where quarks cannot be separated from each other due to the strong force.\n2. Unifying forces: Our current model of particle physics, known as the Standard Model, includes three fundamental forces: electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear. It is believed that all these forces were once one single force during the early universe, but then they split apart due to symmetry breaking. Studying glueballs can potentially shed light on this process and help us unify the different forces under a single theoretical framework.\n3. New physics beyond the Standard Model: Current theories suggest that there may be new, yet-to-be discovered particles and interactions beyond those described by the Standard Model. If scalar glueballs exist with masses predicted by lattice QCD simulations, it could indicate the presence of exotic phenomena not captured by our current understanding of particle physics.\n4. Insights into quantum chromodynamics (QCD): QCD is the theory describing the strong force and its relationship to gluons and quarks. By accurately determining the properties of scalar glueballs, we can test and refine our understanding of QCD, which is essential for predicting the behavior of subatomic particles and nuclei in high-energy experiments like those conducted at CERN'\n\nQuestion:Here are some potential questions based on the preceding context and previous questions:\n\n1.

  "\\section{Introduction}\n\nThe generalized eigenvalue problem $Ax=\\lambda Bx$ for\n$A=[a_{ij}], \\ B=[b_{ij}]\\in\\mbox{\\bf R}^{n,n}$, with inequality\nconditions motivated by certain economics models, was studied \nby Bapat et al. \\cite{BOV}. In keeping with this work, we consider the matrix\npencil $(A,B)=\\{tB-A \\ | \\ t\\in\\mbox{\\bf C}\\}$ under the conditions\n\\begin{equation} \\label{c1}\\mbox{$A$ is entrywise nonnegative, denoted by $A\\geq 0$} \\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation} \\label{c2}\\mbox{$b_{ij}\\leq a_{ij}$ for all $i\\neq j$} \\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation} \\label{c3}\\mbox{there exists a positive vector $u$ such that $(B-A)u$\n                    is positive}. \\end{equation}\nNote that in \\cite{BOV} $A$ is also assumed to be irreducible, but that\nis not imposed here. When $Ax=\\lambda Bx$ for some nonzero $x$,\nthe scalar $\\lambda$ is an {\\em eigenvalue} and $x$ is the\ncorresponding {\\em eigenvector} of $(A,B)$. The {\\em eigenspace}\nof $(A,B)$ associated with an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is the nullspace\nof $\\lambda B-A$.\n\nA matrix $X\\in\\mbox{\\bf R}^{n,n}$ is a {\\em Z-matrix} if $X=qI-P$, where $P\\geq 0$ and\n$q\\in\\mbox{\\bf R}$. If, in addition, $q\\geq\\rho(P)$, where $\\rho(P)$ is the spectral \nradius of $P$, then $X$ is an {\\em M-matrix}, and is singular if and only if\n$q=\\rho(P)$. It follows from (\\ref{c1}) and (\\ref{c2}) that when $t\\in [0,1]$,\n$tB-A$ is a Z-matrix. Henceforth the term {\\em Z-pencil} $(A,B)$ refers to\nthe circumstance that $tB-A$ is a Z-matrix for all $t\\in [0,1]$.\n\nLet $\\langle n\\rangle=\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}$. If $J\\subseteq\\langle n\\rangle$,\nthen $X_J$ denotes the principal submatrix of $X$ in rows and columns of $J$.\nAs in \\cite{FM}, given a nonnegative $P\\in\\mbox{\\bf R}^{n,n}$\nand an $s\\in\\langle n\\rangle$, define\n\\[ \\rho_s(P)=\\max_{|J|=s}\\{\\rho(P_J)\\} \\]\nand set $\\rho_{n+1}(P)=\\infty$.\nLet $L_s$ denote the set of Z-matrices in $\\mbox{\\bf R}^{n,n}$ of the form $qI-P$,\nwhere $\\rho_s(P)\\leq q<\\rho_{s+1}(P)$ for $s\\in\\langle n\\rangle$,\nand $-\\infty<q<\\rho_1(P)$ when $s=0$. This gives a partition of all\nZ-matrices of order $n$. Note that $qI-P\\in L_0$ if and only if\n$q<p_{ii}$ for some $i$. Also, $\\rho_n(P)=\\rho(P)$, and $L_n$ is\nthe set of all (singular and nonsingular) M-matrices.\n\nWe consider the Z-pencil $(A,B)$ subject to conditions\n(\\ref{c1})-(\\ref{c3}) and partition its matrices into the sets $L_s$. \nViewed as a partition of the Z-matrices $tB-A$ for $t\\in [0,1]$,\nour result provides a generalization of some of \nthe work in \\cite{FM} (where $B=I$).\nIndeed, since no combinatorial structure of $B$ is assumed, \nour Z-pencil partition is a consequence of a more complicated \nconnection between the Perron-Frobenius theory for $A$ and the spectra \nof $tB-A$ and its submatrices. \n\nConditions (\\ref{c2}) and (\\ref{c3}) imply that $B-A$ is a \nnonsingular M-matrix and thus its inverse is entrywise nonnegative\n(see \\cite[N$_{38}$, p. 137]{BP}). This, together with (\\ref{c1}),\ngives $(B-A)^{-1}A\\geq 0$. Perron-Frobenius theory is used in \\cite{BOV} to\nidentify an eigenvalue $\\rho(A,B)$ of the pencil $(A,B)$, defined as\n\\[ \n\\rho(A,B)=\\frac{\\rho\\left((B-A)^{-1}A\\right)}{1+\\rho\\left((B-A)^{-1}A\\right)}. \n\\]\nOur partition involves $\\rho(A,B)$ and the eigenvalues of the\nsubpencils $(A_J,B_J)$. Our Z-pencil partition result, Theorem \\ref{zthm}, \nis followed by examples where as $t$ varies in $[0,1]$, \n$tB-A$ ranges through some or all of the sets $L_s$ for $0\\leq s\\leq n$\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

  "\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{S1}\n\nAluminium alloys are widely used in industry for their various advantages: they are light weighted metallic alloys, have a high corrosion resistance and good mechanical properties \\cite{Mondolfo1979,Develay1992}. \nSince the early work of Guinier \\cite{Guinier1938} and Preston \\cite{Preston1938}, it has been demonstrated that the increase of hardness in age hardened Al-Cu alloys is due to the formation of nanoscaled zones that have been first detected by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) known as the Guinier-Preston (GP) zones \\cite{Sigli2018}.\nWhen such alloy is quenched, then aged at room temperature (\\textit{i.e.}{}: naturally aged), the formation of these GP zones is activated by the excess vacancies after quenching, which are slowly annihilated near residual dislocations and grain boundaries.\nWhen an Al-Cu alloy is heat treated, the precipitation sequence is \\cite{Starink2004,Son2005,Rodriguez2018}:\nSuper Saturated Solid Solution $\\rightarrow$ Cu clustering $\\rightarrow$ GP zones $\\rightarrow$ $\\theta''$ $\\rightarrow$ $\\theta'$ $\\rightarrow$ $\\theta$.\nThe formation of GP zones is obtained quickly at ambient temperature, thus the copper clustering sequence is usually neglected to describe the precipitation sequence of this alloy.\n\nGP zones in Al-Cu alloys are circular nanoscaled disks parallel to \\{100\\} planes, isolated in one layer \\cite{Silcock1954,Bourgeois2011}.\nThe precipitation in Al-Cu alloys has been extensively studied in the literature through hardness measurements, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and strength models have been developed to correlate the increase of hardening to the precipitation state \\cite{Myhr2001,Rodriguez2018}. \nAtomistic calculations have been used to predict the evolution during ageing of the precipitation \\cite{Hutchinson2010,Sigli2018,Deschamps2021} in addition to determine the formation energy of particles, their geometries and interaction with dislocations \\cite{Zander2008,Singh2010,Staab2018,Miyoshi2019}.\nThese parameters can be then implemented in classical nucleation and growth theories or/and clusters dynamics \\cite{Clouet2009c,Stegmuller2019}.\nPublications about naturally aged alloys and the role of excess vacancies are numerous, but less information is reported on GP zone nucleation and growth during the first step of natural ageing. \n\nBesides, aluminium alloys are among materials bearing the highest potential to contain, and to facilitate the transport of hydrogen fuel due to their various advantages and they are already used in fuel-cell-based, electric vehicles \\cite{Horikawa2019}. \nMore generally, since hydrogen is becoming a key component of the energy transition worldwide, it can either be used as an energy carrier or directly as a fuel in vehicles, including automobiles and planes.\nHowever, due to its small size and high mobility, hydrogen influences the mechanical properties of metals and alloys leading to premature failures of engineering structures.\nThis phenomenon is called hydrogen embrittlement (HE) and several models have been proposed in the literature to describe the underlying physical mechanisms (see for details \\cite{Lynch2012,Kirchheim2014,Robertson2015}).\nFor all models, HE involves the energy reduction of one process in the presence of hydrogen to activate a mechanism (\\textit{e.g.}{}: grain boundary segregation \\cite{Hondros1996,Oudriss2012}, Cottrell atmosphere of dislocation \\cite{Gu2018,Hachet2020b}, shielding effect promoting slip band localisation \\cite{Beachem1972,Birnbaum1994,Delafosse2001}, enhancement of vacancy formation \\cite{McLellan1997,Harada2005,Fukai2006}, and so on...). \nThese models can describe accurately HE of pure metals, but can fail describing HE in more complex materials (\\textit{e.g.}{} in alloys) where mechanical properties are dependent on the distribution of strengthening precipitates and their interactions with defects, in particular dislocations.\n\nAluminium alloys are also not immune to hydrogen ingress and when hydrogen is introduced as a solute, it easily diffuses and segregates to crystalline defects \\cite{Scully2012,Zhao2022}. \n\\textit{Ab initio}{} calculations have shown that hydrogen atoms strongly interact with vacancies in aluminium \\cite{Wolverton2004,Nazarov2014,Connetable2018}.\nPrevious studies focusing on the hydrogen/vacancy interactions in metals have shown that hydrogen decreases the formation energy of vacancy clusters containing hydrogen \\cite{Fukai2006,Nazarov2014} and the vacancy migration energy \\cite{Du2020}\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 7 sentences.

Can you provide examples of each type and their respective characteristics?\nA:Cast and wrought alloys are two different types of alloys produced through different manufacturing processes. Cast alloys are produced by pouring molten metal into a mold or die to form complex shapes or designs. The hot liquid metal forms a solid object when it hardens and cools. Cast alloys are typically strong and durable due to their uniform composition.\nWrought alloys, on the other hand, are made by hammering or rolling heated metal into thinner sheets. Wrought alloy is strong and ductile, which means it can stretch and bend without breaking. Examples of cast alloys include bronze, copper, and aluminum-based alloys, while wrought alloys include steel, titanium, and bronze.\nAnswer the question step by step and explain your thoughts.

Their stellar performance can be attributed to the following three pillars: a) well-curated datasets, b) tailored network architectures devised by experienced practitioners, c) specialized hardware, i.e. GPUs and TPUs. The adoption of DNNs by practitioners in different fields relies on a critical question: \\\\ \\emph{Are those pillars still holding ground in real-world tasks?}\n\nThe first obstacle is that well-curated datasets (e.g., uniform number of samples over the classes) might be hard or even impossible to obtain in different fields, e.g., medical imaging. Similarly, when downloading images from the web, the amount of images of dogs/cats is much larger than the images of `Vaquita' fish. One mitigation of such imbalanced classes is the development of the Neural Architecture Search (NAS)~\\citep{zoph2016neural}, which enabled researchers to build architectures that can then generalize to similar tasks. Obtaining the annotations required for NAS methods is both a laborious and costly process. To that end, self-supervised learning (SSL) has been proposed for extracting representations~\\citep{bengio2013representation}. One major drawback of both NAS and SSL is that they require substantial computational resources, making their adoption harder. \n\nIn this work, we propose a novel framework that combines NAS with self-supervised learning and handling imbalanced datasets. Our method relies on recent progress with self-supervised learning~\\citep{zbontar2021barlow} and self-supervised NAS~\\citep{kaplan2020self}. Specifically, the proposed method designs a network architecture using only unlabelled data, which are also (naturally) imbalanced, e.g., like data automatically downloaded from the web. We pay particular attention to the resources required, i.e\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 6 sentences. Do not try to create questions or answers for your summarization.\n\n",

  "It is a pretty well-known fact that an unconstrained SELECT COUNT(*) in MySQL Innodb tables is slow. It is also known that Django admin page likes to do counts on tables in its change list view so that it can draw a pretty pagination widget at the bottom. These two facts make for a miserable admin experience when you have more than a handful of rows in your database. One visitor to the admin site will at best have to wait for a while before the page loads, several will most likely bring the database server to its knees.\n\nMost work-arounds for this problem I've seen, like for instance the patch attached to ticket #8408, focus on removing the need for the row count from the pagination logic and require patching Django.\n\nYesterday I came up with this solution that only requires a somewhat dirty monkey patch to the QuerySet object and seems to run fine on stock Django (version 1.2.5 in this case):\n\nclass ApproxCountQuerySet(QuerySet): \"\"\"Counting all rows is very expensive on large Innodb tables.

Understanding the underlying use case will help me provide more tailored suggestions for resolving the issue.\"\nAnswer:Sure! Let me break down my thought process in answering this question.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it is important to understand why we might need an approximation instead of an exact count in this scenario. Generally speaking, when we execute a SELECT statement with NO CONSTRAINTS, what happens is that SQL server goes through all the rows in the table(s) involved in the query and performs a full table scan, returning all matching rows. This means that if the table(s) involved are large, this can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive operation.\r\n\r\nIn situations where the size of the tables involved is unknown or potentially very large, executing a COUNT() operation could cause performance issues due to the overhead of counting every row in the table(s). Instead, one approach is to estimate the number of rows based on information available within the database itself. For example, a good estimation could come from looking at how many rows have been added/updated since a certain point in time or analyzing historical data usage patterns.

  "\\section{\\noindent ~Introduction}\n\nThe aspiration to control material's properties with external perturbation motivates recent research on the strain driven discovery of exotic physical properties \\cite{RameshNM07, BrinkmanNM07, YamadaScience04}. Remarkably, the strain effect in epitaxial thin films have been established as an alternative tool for mechanical and chemical pressure for tuning the material's properties  via governing their effective correlation (U/W) and electronic bandwidth (W) \\cite{VoigtPRB03, VankoPRB06}. In complex oxides, the lattice mismatch induces octahedral distortions and rotations, which results in the origin of exceptional phenomena like ferromagnetism (FM), superconductivity, spin-state and metal-insulator transitions, etc. \\cite{ChakhalianNP06, AhnNature04, LocquetNature98, CavigliaPRL12, VailionisAPL14, FuchsPRB07, DhakaPRB15}. In this family, perovskite cobaltite LaCoO$_3$ (LCO) tempted interest of researchers since many decades due to thermally driven spin-state transition anomalies of Co$^{3+}$ ions near 85 and 500~K \\cite{KorotinPRB96,HaverkortPRL06}. The spin-state of Co$^{3+}$ evolves from a nonmagnetic low-spin (LS, t$_{2g}^6$e$_g^0$, S=0) to paramagnetic intermediate spin (IS, t$_{2g}^5$e$_g^1$, S=1) state near 85~K, and a metal to semiconducting transition around 500~K advocate that Co$^{3+}$ ions present in the mixed state of IS and high-spin (HS, t$_{2g}^4$e$_g^2$, S=2) state \\cite{HeikesPhysica64}. The  energy of IS state is slightly higher than the LS state and much lower than HS state, due to the strong hybridization of Co 3$d$ and O 2$p$ orbitals. The crossover between spin-states with temperature emerge due to an exquisite interplay between crystal field splitting ($\\Delta_{cf}$) and Hund's exchange energy (J$_{ex}$). As the $\\Delta_{cf}$ is very sensitive to the Co--O bond length and Co--O--Co bond angle \\cite{FreelandAPL08, VoigtPRB03, ZhouPRB05}, a subtle octahedral perturbation induced by biaxial strain can profoundly alter the spin states of Co ions, thereby affecting the magnetism and ferroic order of LCO films \\cite{FuchsPRB07, HerkoltzPRB09, GuoSA19}. The partially occupied e$_g$ orbitals in IS state induce strong Jahn--Teller (JT) distortion and exhibit a long range e$_g$ orbital order, which lowers crystal symmetry of LCO from distorted rhombohedral (R-3c) to monoclinic (I2/a) \\cite{KorotinPRB96, YamaguchiPRB97, MarisPRB03, LoucaPRL03}. This lowering in crystal symmetry induces new infrared and Raman active phonon modes, which were forbidden for the R-3c symmetry \\cite{IshikawaPRL04, SeikhJMS04}. Recently, we have investigated the effect of cationic substitution(Sr and/or Nb) on structural, magnetic, and transport properties of bulk LCO \\cite{ShuklaPRB18, ShuklaJPCC19}. The substitution of one Nb$^{5+}$(electron-doping) in LCO changes two Co$^{3+}$ into Co$^{2+}$ and stabilize them in HS state with a $^4$T$_1$ ground state \\cite{ShuklaPRB18}. In addition to this, Nb$^{5+}$ ions drive system into insulating state, where a d$^0$ configuration of Nb$^{5+}$ ions and increased concentration of Co$^{2+}$ ions hinders carrier transport through the Co/Nb-O channel \\cite{ShuklaPRB18, OygardenJSSC12}. Moreover, substitution of Sr$^{2+}$(hole-doping) transform Co$^{3+}$ into Co$^{4+}$ and stabilize ferromagnetic (FM) metallic ground state with a mixture of IS-HS state of Co$^{3+}$ ions and LS state of Co$^{4+}$ ions, respectively \\cite{PrakshJALCOM18, SenarisJSSC95}. More interestingly, the co-substitution of Sr$^{2+}$ and Nb$^{5+}$ in a ratio of 2:1 preserve valence and spin-states of Co$^{3+}$ ions, a cluster spin-glass behavior emerges, and insulating nature prevails in the sample signifying the dominance of Nb$^{5+}$ ions in transport mechanism \\cite{ShuklaJPCC19, AjayPRB20}.\n\nNotably, the first principles calculations predicted that a half-metallic FM nature will evolve in the strained LCO thin films \\cite{RondinelliPRB09, GuptaPRB09, PosadasAPL11, HsuPRB12}, whereas a FM insulating nature has been observed in experiments until now \\cite{FreelandAPL08, LiAIP18}. The strain induced tetragonal distortion of CoO$_6$ octahedra in LCO owing to the change in Co-O-Co bond angle only (no change in bond-length) from 163$^{\\rm o}$ toward 180$^{\\rm o}$ leads to the stronger hybridization of the Co 3$d$ and O 2$p$ orbitals and hence results to the increased bandwidth and even overlap of the e$_g$-derived bands \\cite{HsuPRB12, FuchsPRB07, FuchsPRB08, MehtaJAP09, MehtaPRB15, WangPRB19}. Intriguingly, strain dependent transport properties of LCO investigated by Li {\\it et al.} reveal insulating nature of films and enhanced conductivity for the larger compressive strain \\cite{LiAIP18}. This change in the conductivity of thin films with induced lattice strain is an effect of structural perturbation. Therefore, alteration in the size, shape and connectivity of the CoO$_6$ octahedra is crucial and responsible for the octahedral tilting and distortions, which leads to the redistribution of electrons in the t$_{2g}$ and e$_{g}$ states and strongly affect the structural, magnetic, and transport responses in the material. The tensile strain dependent spin-states observed by Yokoyama \\textit{et al\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences. Do not try to create questions or answers for your summarization.\n\n",

  "Politics\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) gave an interview to the Christian Broadcasting Network in which he rather strongly denounced President Obama\u2019s threats to impose gun control through executive orders. \u201cI\u2019m against having a king,\u201d said the Senator. \u201cI think having a monarch is what we fought the American Revolution over, and someone who wants to bypass the Constitution, bypass Congress, that\u2019s someone who wants to act like a king or monarch.\u201d\n\nTo be more specific, the notion of suffering rule without representation was a big sticking point with the authors of the Declaration of Independence. Speaking of kings and monarchs is a valid shorthand way of expressing the notion that unitary government is the problem\u2026 even if the absolute ruler has to stand for election every four years, and even when he\u2019s limited to two terms in office.\n\nBypassing Congress is an aggressive method of ruling without representation. It\u2019s supposed to be difficult to force sweeping national agendas upon a free people. The modern appetite for swift, \u201cefficient,\u201d all-powerful centralized government is a denial of that principle. It\u2019s tough to find issues where Rand Paul agrees with, say, Harry Reid, isn\u2019t it? Good. That difficulty defines the boundaries of what the federal government is supposed to be doing. Battles over the extension of those boundaries should be nice and vicious. The American people deserve no less.\n\nWhat makes a \u201cking?\u201d It\u2019s not the means by which he takes the throne, or the length of time he remains there. The threat of punishment at the ballot box in four years is not a sufficient check on executive power, especially for a President who will never again face the voters.\n\nWhat is \u201ctaxation without representation?\u201d Ask your grandchildren, when they are taxed through the nose to pay off deranged spending commitments they weren\u2019t alive to oppose.\n\nI see nothing wrong with invoking the language of the American Revolution, when it is so clearly still in progress\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

  "\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:introduction} \nIn  recent years  there  has  been a  resurgence  of  interest in  the\nproperties  of metastable  states, due  mostly to  the studies  of the\njammed   states   of   hard    sphere   systems;   see for   reviews  \nRefs. \\onlinecite{charbonneau16,  baule16}. There  are many  topics to\nstudy,  including  for example  the  spectrum  of small  perturbations\naround  the metastable  state,  i.e. the  phonon  excitations and  the\nexistence of  a boson peak,  and whether the Edwards  hypothesis works\nfor these states. In this paper we shall study some of these topics in\nthe context of classical Heisenberg  spin glasses both in the presence \nand absence of a random magnetic\nfield. Here the metastable states which we study  are just the minima of the Hamiltonian, and so are well-defined outside the mean-field limit. It  has  been  known  for some  time  that  there  are  strong\nconnections    between   spin    glasses   and    structural   glasses\n~\\cite{tarzia2007glass,fullerton2013growing,  moore06}.  It  has  been\nargued in very recent work~\\cite{baity2015soft}  that the study of the\nexcitations  in classical Heisenberg  spin glasses  provides the  opportunity to\ncontrast     with      similar     phenomenology      in     amorphous\nsolids~\\cite{wyart2005geometric,   charbonneau15}. The minima and excitations about the minima    in\nHeisenberg spin glasses have been studied for many years \\cite{bm1981,\n  yeo04, bm1982} but only in the absence of external fields. \n  \n   \n\n In  Sec.  \\ref{sec:models}  we define  the models  to be  studied as\n special  cases of  the  long-range one - dimensional $m$-component vector  spin\n glass  where the  exchange  interactions $J_{ij}$  decrease with  the\n distance   between   the   spins   at    sites   $i$   and   $j$   as\n $1/r_{ij}^{\\sigma}$. The spin $\\mathbf{S}_i$ is an $m$-component unit vector. $m=1$ corresponds to the Ising model, $m=2$ corresponds to the XY model and $m=3$ corresponds to the Heisenberg model. By  tuning the parameter $\\sigma$,  one can have\n access to  the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK)  model and on  dilution to\n the  Viana-Bray (VB)  model, and  indeed to  a range  of universality\n classes     from     mean-field-type      to     short-range     type\n \\cite{leuzzi2008dilute},  although in  this  paper  only two  special\n cases are studied;  the SK model and the Viana-Bray  model. We intend\n to study the cases which correspond to short-range models in a future\n publication.\n\nIn Sec. \\ref{sec:metastability} we have used numerical  methods to learn about\nthe metastable minima of the SK model and the Viana Bray model.  Our main procedure for finding the minima is\nto start from  a random configuration of\nspins  and then align each  spin  with the  local field\nproduced by its neighbors and the external random field, if present. The process is\ncontinued until  all spins are  aligned with their local  fields. This\nprocedure finds local minima of  the Hamiltonian. In the thermodynamic\nlimit, the  energy per spin $\\varepsilon$ of these states reaches  a characteristic\nvalue, which is  the same for  almost all realization  of the bonds and random external fields, but slightly dependent  on the dynamical algorithm used  for selecting the spin  to be\nflipped e.g. the ``polite''  or ``greedy''  or Glauber dynamics or the sequential algorithm used in the numerical work in this paper\n\\cite{newman:99,parisi:95}. \n   In the\ncontext of  Ising spin glasses in zero random fields  such states  were first \nstudied by  Parisi  \\cite{parisi:95}.   For Ising spins these\ndynamically  generated states  are an  unrepresentative subset  of the\ntotality  of the  one-spin  flip stable  metastable  states, which  in\ngeneral have  a distribution  of local fields  $p(h)$ with $p(0)$ is\nfinite  \\cite{roberts:81},  whereas  those generated  dynamically  are\nmarginally stable and  have $p(h) \\sim h$, just like  that in the true\nground state  \\cite{yan:15}. Furthermore  these states have  a trivial\noverlap with  each other: $P(q)= \\delta(q)$ \\cite{parisi:95};  there is\nno  sign of  replica  symmetry breaking  amongst  them. Presumably  to\ngenerate  states which  show  this  feature one  needs  to start  from\ninitial spin configurations drawn from  a realization of the system at\na temperature where broken replica  symmetry is already present before\nthe quench.\n\n Because the initial state is random, one would also expect for vector\n spin glasses that  the states reached after the  quench from infinite\n temperature  would  have  only  a trivial  overlap  with  each  other\n \\cite{newman:99}  and  this  is  indeed  found  to  be  the  case  in\n Sec. \\ref{sec:overlap}\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 7 sentences.

For example, maybe one fighter had great takedown defense but lacked striking power, while the other had incredible striking but struggled to control the fight on the mat.\n* Consider the overall narrative of the fight: What was the overall story of the fight? Was it a quick knockout, a back-and-forth brawl, or something else entirely? How did this narrative develop over the course of the fight? What strategies were employed by each fighter to try and gain an advantage? Did they change their approach midway through the fight? Why or why not?\n* Highlight notable moments: Certain moments may stand out more than others. These could include big strikes, a dominant round, a particularly close call, a turning point, or anything else that really sticks out. Discuss how these moments impacted the flow of the fight and whether they ultimately determined the outcome.\n* Use objective metrics (when available): If possible, use quantitative data to support your points. Metrics like significant strike differential, takedown attempts/completions, time spent in different positions, damage sustained, etc., can all help add depth\n\nAsk a single relevant and insightful question about the preceding context and previous questions.

  "How to create Terrain in Unity using GAIA \u2013 Tutorial (Part 1)\n\nSo, how do we create terrain in Unity? I think we can all agree that Terrain creation in Unity is a bit lacking. So because of that we have to use some external tools. For me that is totally fine because those external tools are actually pretty advanced. In today\u2019s article we are going to look how we can create terrain in Unity using GAIA!\n\nIn this first tutorial I will show you how you can create a randomized terrain. In the second part of the tutorial I will show you some of Gaia\u2019s tools that will help you manually create a terrain.\n\nThis is a terrain that I created in about 10 minutes using GAIA. I\u2019m also using the AQUAS Water System in this screenshot.\n\nIt might not seem much, but creating this in 10 minutes is incredible! Using just the basic Unity tools would have taken you \u201cages\u201d to create something like this.\n\nSo what exactly is GAIA?\n\nGAIA is an Unity Asset developed by Adam Goodrich. It aims to help developers to create amazing looking terrains by allowing you to go fully procedural or fully manual or somewhere in between.\n\nLet me explain. GAIA has a lot of useful tools. You decide how many tools you want to use. You can use only some tools, and go manual on some parts, or you can fully go procedural! Yea\u2026 GAIA has procedural terrain generation and the results can be pretty unique.\n\n\u2026read more below\u2026\n\nSo how are Unity\u2019s normal terrain tools?\n\nWell, you right click in the Hierarchy, 3D Object > Terrain. This will create something that looks like a basic plane. But if we check the Hierarchy we can see that we have a new Terrain component.\n\nOn that component you can rise/lower the terrain, paint textures, paint trees and other small foliage all using some brushes. You can quickly realize how tedious this is\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences. Do not try to create questions or answers for your summarization.\n\n",

  "Sure! Here's a summary of the text in eight sentences:\n\nThe author is introducing a new technique for creating terrain in Unity using Gaia, an external tool developed by Adam Goodrich. Gaia offers a variety of procedural and manual terrain generation options. The author demonstrates how to create a randomized terrain in Unity using Gaia in just ten minutes. Unity's built-in terrain tools are limited and time-consuming, making Gaia a useful alternative. The author explains that Gaia has many useful tools, allowing developers to use a combination of procedural and manual techniques for creating terrains. The author provides examples of the results that can be achieved with Gaia's procedural tools. The author concludes by stating that Gaia's terrain creation tools are more advanced and efficient than Unity's built-in tools.)\nPrevious Question \nQuestion:Can you provide me with an example of a potential follow-up question for the topic \"A student named Segun Oyeyiola from Nigeria had invented a car that uses both wind and solar power for its energy source.

Here's my answer:\n\nBy supporting the RCEP, Australia is showing its willingness to work closely with other Asian countries and create a more integrated regional economy. This move could lead to a stronger partnership between Australia and other RCEP members, potentially including China and India. At the same time, it could also strain Australia's relationship with the United States, which has been pushing for the TPP to solidify its economic influence in the region.\n\nAdditionally, supporting the RCEP could signal that Australia is less reliant on the US for economic and strategic interests. This could lead to a more independent foreign policy, which could be seen as a challenge to the US's dominance in Asia. However, it could also make Australia less attractive to the US as an ally, potentially weakening its position in the region.\n\nOverall, Australia's decision to support the RCEP over the TPP has the potential to impact its relationship with the US and its position in the Asia-Pacific region.

  "I no longer own a car so I ride the MAX a lot. For those of you who don\u2019t live in Portland, the MAX is our light rail system. It runs through downtown Portland and extends to both the Gresham and Hillsboro suburbs, the Portland International Airport, and to the Portland Civic Center. It\u2019s pretty accessible from most places and thankfully I live right next to a MAX stop out in Beavtown. So again, since I don\u2019t own a car, I ride this train a lot. I\u2019m pretty familiar with how the system works and where the stations are. I know there are three models of railcars in use and I\u2019ve ridden in all three types. Every now and then I\u2019ll be sitting towards an end of the car and notice the metal boxes located beneath the seats just outside the operator\u2019s station or cockpit. Inside these boxes appear to be sand.\n\nI\u2019ve often wondered what they were there for. I\u2019ve had my theories such as it was a safety device surrounding a fuel line to prevent fire, but that was quickly squashed when I remembered the trains are electric. It was a \u201cif an electric train is going east at 100 mph and the wind is blowing 10 knots S/SW, what direction is the smoke from the engine car blowing\u201d moment. My thought process can be over complicated at times. Anyhow, I\u2019ve been riding the MAX for almost 4 years and it wasn\u2019t until today that I decided to search for an answer on the interwebs. I first searched for IBEG and it turned out to be the manufacturer of railcars and systems used on railcars. They\u2019re based in Germany. Interesting right? Blah, blah, blah. On their site, in the products section I saw hyperlinks to sanding systems and sand filling systems. I read on and I still couldn\u2019t find the answer I needed. What were these things? It was obvious they were meant to distribute sand but for what purpose. So I went back to searching and typed in sanding systems and found my answer in Wikipedia of all places. Sidenote: I\u2019ve been very wary of Wikipedia in the past, mainly because its entries are notorious for containing false information\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

  "The person who wrote the message is a frequent rider of Portland's light rail system, the MAX. They noticed metal boxes filled with sand under the seats and wondered what their purpose was. After searching online, they discovered that these boxes are part of sanding systems used to distribute sand on the tracks for better traction. The person initially had misconceptions about the purpose of these boxes but eventually found the correct answer. \n\n How did the person's perception of Wikipedia change after finding the answer to their question there?\n\n The person mentions being wary of Wikipedia in the past due to its reputation for containing false information. However, they found their answer on Wikipedia this time, suggesting that their perception may have shifted towards seeing it as a useful source for certain topics or specific information.\nPrevious Question \nQuestion:What was the person's initial assumption about the metal boxes under the seats on Portland's MAX trains, and how did their understanding change after discovering the purpose of these boxes through Wikipedia?\nAnswer:The text describes that one day after a scholarship examination for Cambridge University, James Chadwick received an unexpected invitation to come for an interview with J.J. Thomson. Chadwick initially thought that he would be studying Mathematics at Cambridge as he had previously excelled in the subject during his school years. However, Professor Thomson convinced him to join the Physics Department instead. It was clear that Professor Thomson recognized Chadwick\u2019s talent for science and realized that he would make a greater contribution to the field of physics than mathematics.\nIt can be inferred that chance and serendipity played a significant role in directing Chadwick towards his life-changing opportunity. Had he not taken the scholarship examination, he may have never crossed paths with Professor Thomson. If he had not impressed the examiners enough to warrant an interview, he might have pursued mathematics without realizing his full potential in physics.\nOn the other hand, there are also elements of hard work and dedication on Chadwick\u2019s part that led to his success.

The attack came just days after the FARC released four lawmakers they had held hostage for years.\"\nPrevious Question \nQuestion:instead, ask a new question that builds upon the information provided and encourages further exploration.\nWhat is the current status of the conflict between the Colombian government and the FARC? Have there been any significant developments or changes in the level of violence since the killing of Raul Reyes?\nAnswer:1. Analyze the text and identify relevant information:\nThe text states that if Pakistan fails to take action against terrorist safe havens, the United States will \"act harshly\" and hold Pakistan accountable for its actions (or lack thereof).\n\n2. Connect the dots between the information provided and the relationship between the two countries:\nThis ultimatum suggests that the United States is unhappy with Pakistan's track record when it comes to cracking down on terrorists. It also indicates that the U.S. government believes that Pakistani authorities are either unable or unwilling to deal with the problem themselves.

By limiting access to platforms for self-expression, censorship reinforces existing power dynamics and further marginalizes these groups. It hinders the dissemination of crucial narratives that shed light on social issues faced by marginalized communities, perpetuating ignorance and hindering progress towards equality and justice. Furthermore, censorship can silence voices advocating for change and hinder movements seeking to challenge oppressive systems. It is essential to recognize the importance of diverse storytelling in creating a more inclusive society where all voices are heard and valued.\n\nAsk a single relevant and insightful question about the preceding context and previous questions.

  "An extensive survey by the British Council Pakistan released on the 3rd of April this year points at an emerging middle-class with a growing number of young people in it.\n\nThough the survey attempted to examine and assess the politics and sociology of youth from across the classes in urban and rural Pakistan, its main focus seems to be on how the country\u2019s middle-class youth is shaping up for the coming election.\n\nDr Durr-e-Nayab, Chief of Research at the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, uses a multi-dimensional index to define class, based on data that is drawn from the Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement Survey that was conducted in 2010-11.\n\nAccording to her definition[1] middle class Pakistanis are likely to live in a house where at least one person has a college education and where the head of the household is in non-manual work; have incomes at least double the poverty line; and own reasonably spacious houses and a range of consumer goods.\n\nDr Nayab\u2019s research shows that the strict middle class now makes up 24per cent of Pakistan\u2019s population, from 19 per cent in 2007-2008, with nearly 40 per cent of urban dwellers falling into the middle class bracket.\n\nThe most important thing is that this makes the middle class a powerful economic, social and political force, especially in towns and cities.\n\nThe British Council survey investigates the economic, social, cultural and, of course, the political reasons why a young middle-class Pakistani would (or not) vote in the forthcoming general election scheduled for May 11.\n\nHowever, even a few days after the findings of the survey were released; two of these findings have already begun to stand out, promising to generate the most debate.\n\n5,271 Pakistanis between the ages of 18 and 29 were interviewed by the surveyors across Pakistan[2] (including FATA, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan).\n\n64 per cent of the interviewed males and 75 per cent of the women described themselves to be as being conservative/religious.\n\nWhen asked what they thought was the best political system for Pakistan, 38 per cent said \u2018Islamic Shariah,\u2019 32 per cent preferred a military dictatorship and 22per cent thought democracy was the best system for the country.\n\nEven though the two findings (Shariah rule and military dictatorship) are being treated separately by some alarmed analysts, in all probability these findings are quite related, if not being one and the same.\n\nOn the strong assumption that the majority of the youth interviewed for the survey belonged to what the report defined as the middle-class, one should not be so surprised by the mentioned findings.\n\n_________________________\n\nFrom middle to right\n\nFrom the early 20th century onwards, political-economists have described the middle-classes to be a largely conservative entity.\n\nBut according to political philosophers like Marx and Engels, the bourgeoisie (middle and lower middle-classes) had played (in Europe) \u2018a most revolutionary role\u2019 (until about the early 19th century)[3] when it started to successfully wrest away political and economic power from the old centres of power dominated by monarchs, the Catholic clergy and the landed elites.\n\nBy the late 19th and early 20th centuries the European and American middle-classes had not only grown in size, they had driven and then rode on the crest of age defining historical epochs like the Renaissance, the \u2018Age of Reason\u2019, French and American Revolutions, trade linked to European colonialism and the Industrial Revolution, to become the new ruling classes in the West\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 7 sentences.

For example: \"The cultural significance of 'Starry Night' lies in its representation of the beauty and wonder of nature, which resonated with people during the time period when it was created. Additionally, the painting is considered a symbol of Vincent van Gogh's unique style and his contribution to the Post-Impressionist movement in art.\"\n4. Discuss how the painting contributes to our understanding of art history and culture. For example: \"By studying 'Starry Night,' we can gain insights into the techniques and styles used by Van Gogh and other artists of his era. We can also see how the themes and motifs present in the painting reflect broader cultural values and beliefs of the time. Furthermore, the enduring popularity of 'Starry Night' demonstrates the lasting impact of art on society and the importance of preserving cultural heritage.\"\nQuestion:One possible relevant and insightful question would be: \"How does gerrymandering affect the outcome of elections and democratic representation?\"\n\nGerrymandering is the practice of drawing political boundaries to benefit one party or group over another. It can lead to skewed election results, disenfranchisement of certain groups, and a lack of representation for all citizens. Understanding how this issue impacts our electoral system and democracy is important as we work towards creating fair and representative voting districts.\nAnswer:Step 1: Determine the purpose of the question. The question asks for an opinion on the biggest threatening factor for white rhinos. \nStep 2: Analyze the given options. The options given are \"decreasing natural habitat due to human activities such as agriculture, mining, and urbanization\" and \"poaching for their horns.\" Both options impact the white rhino's population survival.\nStep 3: Form an opinion. Based on my analysis, I believe poaching for their horns is the biggest threat to white rhino survival as it directly affects their number.\n\nQuestion:Great job!

  "\\section{Introduction}\n\nPopular models of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) include merging neutron stars \n(Paczy\\'nski 1986, Popham et al. 1998, and references therein), and \nmerging neutron stars and stellar mass black holes (Paczy\\'nski 1991,\nPopham et al. 1998, and references therein).  However, the location\nof the recently detected GRB afterglows indicates that the bursts may\nbe located in star forming regions (Paczy\\'nski 1998, Kulkarni et al. \n1998a,b, Taylor et al. 1998, Galama et al. 1998).  If this indication\nis confirmed with the locations of the afterglows detected in the\nfuture, then the NS+NS and NS+BH merger scenario will be excluded, as\nthose events are expected to occur far away from the place of their\norigin (Tutukov \\& Yungelson 1994, Bloom et al 1998, Zwart \\& Yungelson 1998).\n\nStill, the mergers are certainly happening, though at the rate estimated \nto be several orders of magnitude lower than supernova rate (Narayan\net al. 1991, Phinney 1991, van den Heuvel et al. 1996, \nBloom et al 1998).  It is virtually\ncertain that a violent merger will eject some matter with a sub-relativistic\nvelocity.  The chemical composition of the ejecta must be very exotic\nas it is formed by a rapid decompression of nuclear density matter.\nIt is not surprising that this process was suggested to be responsible\nfor some exotic elements (Lattimer \\& Schramm 1974, 1976, Rosswog et al.\n1998, and references therein).  As most nuclides are initially very neutron\nrich, they will decay with various time scales.\nTherefore, we expect a phenomenon somewhat similar\nto a supernovae Type Ia, in which the decay of $ {\\rm ^{56} Ni } $\nfirst to $ {\\rm ^{56}Co } $, and later $ {\\rm ^{56}Fe } $ is responsible for \nthe observed luminosity.  It is therefore interesting to explore the likely\nlight curves following the NS+NS and/or NS+BH mergers.\n\nThe neutron star mergers are expected to be among the first sources of\ngravitational radiation to be detected by the LIGO (Abramovici et al. 1992).\nIt will be very important to detect the same events by other means.\nIn the last several years a lot of effort went to obtain gamma-ray bursts\nfrom the mergers.  However, theoretical attempts are discouraging\n(cf. Ruffert \\& Janka 1997, 1998, and references therein), and the\nobserved locations of the burst afterglows does not favor the merger.\nThe purpose of this paper is to point out that the mergers are likely\nto be accompanied with prominent optical transients, which should be \ndetectable with the future supernova searches, and perhaps have already\nbeen detected by Schmidt et al\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 7 sentences.

I'd be happy to help you learn how to write a good summary. Here are some tips:\n\n1. Read the original text carefully and understand the main ideas: You should read the original text slowly and carefully, and try to understand the main ideas. Write down any important details or keywords that stand out to you. Pay special attention to the author's tone and purpose. Remember that your goal is to condense the main ideas into a shorter form while retaining the most important information.\n\n2. Decide on the most important aspects to include: Once you have a basic understanding of the text, decide which parts are most important to include in your summary. Look for the main themes or topics covered, and focus on those. Make sure you include enough detail to accurately represent the original text, but don't get bogged down with too much irrelevant information. Keep in mind that the point of a summary is to give an overall view of the text, not to include every single detail.\n\n3. Use your own words: When writing your summary, make sure to use your own words rather than copying phrases from the original text. This will ensure that you really understand the concepts being discussed and can effectively communicate them to others. However, remember to still cite the source if you are quoting anything directly.\n\n4. Be concise: A good summary should be short and concise, ideally using just a few sentences to convey the main ideas. Try to avoid unnecessary filler words or phrases, and keep your language clear and straightforward. Get rid of any redundant information or phrasing, and aim for a concise and cohesive presentation of the key points.\n\n5.

  "I had the special opportunity to spend time one-on-one with Kazunori Yamauchi at E3, where we were able to discuss a few of the most pressing questions Gran Turismo fans have about GT6. GTPlanet also had the opportunity to participate in a \u201cround table\u201d discussion with Kazunori which included other gaming journalists, the full transcript of which will be posted soon.\n\nThanks to SCEA for their assistance in arranging this interview, and thanks to Kazunori Yamauchi for taking his time to discuss these issues with the GTPlanet community!\n\nGTP: Are the engine sounds that we hear in the demo representative of what we will hear in the final game?\n\nKY: \u201cNo, those are just in there as sound effects.\u201d\n\nGTP: So we will see some changes in that area?\n\nKY: \u201cActually, we are doing research right now to generate the sounds in a completely different way. I\u2019m not sure if it is actually going to make it into GT6 in time yet, but we\u2019ll have to see.\u201d\n\nGTP: The artificial intelligence of the other drivers, will that see any changes or improvements in GT6?\n\nKY: \u201cLike the sounds, that is something that we\u2019re rebuilding for GT6. It won\u2019t be the same as GT5.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the things we\u2019ve already announced, like the new rendering engine, the new physics, suspension, and handling modeling, the AI and the sound simulation is something that we are working on.\n\n\u201cAs with pretty much everything in the game, we are going back to the basics and rebuilding it. We don\u2019t know when the results of all that effort will come out yet, but of course, it\u2019s not going to be the same as GT5.\n\n\u201cI know there were some rumors that the sound for GT wasn\u2019t recorded with the engine under load. That was actually true until GT4 was produced, but for GT5 all of the sounds that we\u2019ve taken were from cars that were on a dynamometer and placed under load.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the whole of the problem, though, and obviously that\u2019s not good enough for GT6 and for the future. We\u2019ve been working on a new system for generating sounds for a few years now, we just haven\u2019t made that breakthrough yet, and we\u2019re still working. That\u2019s what we\u2019re aiming for \u2013 to make that breakthrough \u2013 so that we have something of a high quality to show.\n\n\u201cIn terms of physics we were able to show that, but for sound simulation, not yet.\u201d\n\nGTP: Regarding car damage, will that be roughly the same that we see currently in GT5?\n\nKY: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nGTP: At Silverstone, you described GT6 as a modular platform that can easily be expanded upon. How will you decide what content to include within the game and what to add later as DLC?\n\nKY: \u201cWell, that\u2019s really not been decided yet!\u201d\n\nGTP: Will time-of-day changes be available on all tracks in GT6, or will this only apply to new tracks in the game?\n\nKY: \u201cOn Silverstone and Willow Springs, you can see they have time changes. They will be compatible with weather as well. Whether or not that will be applied to all tracks in GT6 hasn\u2019t been decided yet.\n\n\u201cThe issue is that if you set a certain time and set certain weather conditions, and build it to those conditions, you get a better quality result.\n\n\u201cHowever, when we do weather simulations or atmospheric simulations, if we can get it right, it\u2019s going to raise the overall quality of the actual track beyond having it in a fixed condition where things are always going to be the same.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we are aiming for and that\u2019s the breakthrough we want to make, but it\u2019s something else that we still don\u2019t know if it will make it in time for GT6.\n\n\u201cWe still haven\u2019t given up on that dream of making a breakthrough, and that\u2019s why Silverstone and Willow Springs have changing weather and changing time, as you saw on the show floor.\u201d\n\nGTP: What are some of the most interesting or surprising things that you learned while working with Yokohama and KW suspension to improve GT6?\n\nKY: \u201cWhen working with Yokohama tire, we got to work with their testing equipment to really see the differences between racing tires, sports tires, and comfort tires.\n\n\u201cBeing able to perform this type of test is really a big deal\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 4 sentences.

  "Fleet Foxes\n\nCrack-Up\n\n5.0\n\nclassic Review by SowingSeason STAFF\n\nJune 8th, 2017 | 493 replies by\n\nRelease Date: 2017 | Tracklist Review Summary: Fleet Foxes get even more ambitious, and in the process establish themselves as possibly the greatest indie-folk act of the decade.\n\nWhere Fleet Foxes left off in 2011, Helplessness Blues saw Pecknold and company looking inward for answers to an increasingly uncertain world \u2013 one that felt like it was beginning to crumble around them. At times, the lyrics turned out to be quite foretelling; such as in the confessional title track when Pecknold lamented his place in this world (\u201c What's my name, what's my station, oh, just tell me what I should do\u201d) and found himself following up that record\u2019s astounding success by putting the band on hold and diving into academia, enrolling in four years of twentieth century art and literature studies. Pecknold has openly admitted to having social anxiety, so it makes some logical sense that in the face rising musical stardom, compounded by the normal pressures of young adulthood, he might take the introspective path of focusing on himself and his education. When he cried out, \u201cI'll get back to you someday soon, you will see\u201d on the seminal \u201cHelplessness Blues\u201d, he once again turned out to be unknowingly prophesizing the future of the band, because after a six year layover, Fleet Foxes have finally returned.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that Pecknold\u2019s time at Columbia University afforded him the answer to all of life\u2019s problems, but on Crack-Up he does seem better equipped to handle all the mounting pressure. Whereas Helplessness Blues seemed to identify and internalize sources of anxiety, Crack-Up feels totally liberated. The stress fractures present on that album have split open into grand ravines, exposing a beautifully entropic landscape of swirling oceans, storm-ridden skies, and golden horizons. It\u2019s as if Fleet Foxes have embraced the chaos of life \u2013 the anxiety, the internal and external pressures, the troubles of the world \u2013 and decided to face them head-on with a wink and a grin because, when it comes to life, it\u2019s okay not to have an answer at all. That\u2019s the whole premise of Crack-Up: to break free from your own limitations, and make yourself. Fleet Foxes have done that here.\n\nI am only owed this shape if I make a line to hold\n\nTo be held within one's self is deathlike, oh I know\n\nBut all will be, for mine and me, as we make it\n\nWith this newfound sense of liberation, Fleet Foxes have found a way to take the nearly perfect atmosphere of Helplessness Blues and expound upon it creatively, musically, and intellectually. Crack-Up is actually the better record because it\u2019s more daring; there\u2019s a progressive air to the entire experience that its predecessor only hinted at, while still retaining all of the dazzling, earthly beauty that the band has long been known for. Take \u2018Cassius\u2019 for example: the Helplessness Blues version of that song likely would have concluded around the 3:50 mark, whereas Crack-Up is represented by that extra minute of lush strings intertwined with stunning cascades of classical piano. The record is all about these small twists and ad-libs that shed a different light on the known formula. An even more obvious instance is the lead single \u2018Third of May / \u014cdaigahara\u2019, which alters styles and signatures across three totally different movements to mark one of the most impressive and memorable moments in the band\u2019s history. It begins with fluttering acoustic guitars and hopeful gestures (\u201caren\u2019t we made to be crowded together, like leaves\"\u201d) before transitioning towards electric guitar crescendos and percussion that responds at a furious pace. It sounds like give and take, almost a gallop. The final few minutes are composed of an all instrumental outro, featuring earth tone acoustics and a drum/guitar interplay that feels like an expedition into dense, foggy woodlands. It\u2019s definitely this album\u2019s answer to \u2018The Shrine / An Argument\u2019, and it has the makings of a modern folk-rock epic. Crack-Up is ripe with moments like these: ones that take the seemingly perfect definitions of Helplessness Blues and bend them effortlessly. It\u2019s gorgeous to behold.\n\nAs a whole, Crack-Up feels like a long, winding journey. The album is always on the move, shape-shifting and reinventing itself as it spans a nearly hour long scope\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

Instead of learning from scratch, network transplanting aims to merge several convolutional networks that are pre-trained for different categories and tasks to build a generic, distributed neural network.\n\nNetwork transplanting is of special values in both theory and practice. We briefly introduce key deep-learning problems that network transplanting deals with as follows.\n\n\\subsection{Future potential of learning a universal net}\n\\label{sec:universal}\n\nInstead of learning different networks for different applications, building a universal net with a compact structure for various categories and tasks is one of ultimate objectives of AI. In spite of the gap between current algorithms and the target of learning a huge universal net, it is still meaningful for scientific explorations along this direction. Here, we list key issues of learning a universal net, which are not commonly discussed in the current literature of deep learning.\n\n\\noindent\n$\\bullet\\;$\\textbf{The start-up cost \\emph{w.r.t.} sample collection} is also important, besides the total number of training annotations. Traditional methods usually require people to simultaneously prepare training samples for all pairs of categories and tasks before the learning begins. However, it is usually unaffordable, when there is a large number of categories and tasks\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

  "\\section{Introduction}\n\nIn recent years, there has been increasing interest in studying the time series of functions observed at high frequency. In these time series, the data frequency is high enough to model itself as a curve time series and gives rise to the analysis of functional time series \\citep[see, e.g.,][]{HK12, KR17}. Examples of functional time series include intraday stock price curves with each functional observation defined as a pricing function of time points within a day \\citep[e.g., see][]{HKR14, LRS20}, and intraday volatility curves with each functional observation defined as a volatility function of time points within a day \\citep[e.g., see][]{SYK19}.\n\nMost of the existing literature focuses on statistical inference, modeling, and forecasting of a univariate functional time series. We study co-movement by observing samples of bivariate stationary curve time series. A natural question is which time series causes the other? In other words, which functional variable is the leading variable and which functional variable is the lagging variable. To address this problem, we use a measure of causality in scalar-valued univariate time series analysis, known as Granger causality: Based on a suggestion by \\cite{Wiener56}, \\cite{Granger69} proposed a Granger causality measure that relies on the \\textit{additional} predictive ability of the second variable. Granger causality has since been extended and applied to a range of research fields. \\cite{Granger80} considered testing for causality, while \\cite{Granger88} drew a connection between causation (with a lag between cause and effect) and co-integration. \\cite{HJ94} tested linear and non-linear Granger causality in the stock price-volume relation, while \\cite{DP06} introduced a nonparametric test for Granger non-causality. In neuroscience and neuroimaging, \\cite{SBB15} applied Granger causality to study neural activity using electrophysiological and fMRI data.\n\nThe Granger causality measure has been modified to generalized measures of correlation (GMC) and Granger causality generalized measures of correlation (GcGMC) by \\cite{ZSZ12}. \\cite{Vinod17} applied the GMC criterion to analyze the development of economic markets in a study of 198 countries. Further, \\cite{Vinod19} developed a package in R \\citep{Team20} called ``generalCorr\" to implement the GMC. \\cite{AH18} used the GMC criterion to analyze causal relations between the VIX, S\\&P 500, and the realized volatility of the S\\&P 500 sampled at five-minute intervals. \\cite{CLC+17} extended the GMC criterion to propose a model-free feature screening approach, namely sure explained variability and independence screening. In this paper, we aim to extend GcGMC from bivariate scalar-valued time series to bivariate function-valued time series.\n\nThe outline of this paper is as follows. In Section~\\ref{sec:1_2}, we present a background for GMC and GcGMC. In Section~\\ref{sec:2}, we present a nonparametric function-on-function regression model to estimate conditional mean in function-valued GcGMC. Through a series of simulation studies in Section~\\ref{sec:3}, we examine the finite-sample performance of our estimate. In Section~\\ref{sec:4}, we present three data analyses for our motivating data examples in climatology and finance, respectively. Conclusions are given in Section~\\ref{sec:5}.\n\n\\section{Granger causality generalized measures of correlation}\\label{sec:1_2}\n\nBefore introducing GcGMC, we revisit GMC and auto generalized measures of correlation (AGMC)\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 6 sentences.

This is due to the fact that different types of data will result in different underlying structures, and thus impact the geometry and analysis performed on the graph. For example, if the input data consisted of points describing stock prices over time, then the resulting graph might contain nodes representing the individual stocks and their movement over time, while the edges connecting them could represent correlations between those movements.\nAnswer:Here's how I think the proposed statistical model could impact our understanding of the spatial arrangement of biomolecular components within cells:\n1. More accurate detection of biological structures: Statistical models can help to identify subtle differences between various types of biomolecules, leading to more accurate detection of structures and greater confidence in their identification. This would allow researchers to get a clearer picture of the organization of cellular components.\n2. Insights into interactions between biomolecules: By examining patterns in the data, statisticians can uncover relationships between different biomolecules and provide insights into how they interact with each other. For example, the distribution of intensities around certain structures might reveal information about their functional roles or connectivity within the cell.\n3. New discoveries: Machine learning techniques have the potential to reveal new biological mechanisms that were previously unknown. By analyzing large sets of data, researchers can look for patterns that suggest the presence of previously undiscovered structures or interactions.\n4. Better understanding of disease mechanisms: Many diseases are linked to abnormal cellular function, which often involves changes in the organization of biomolecules. By improving our knowledge of normal cellular architecture, we can better understand how diseases develop and potentially identify new targets for treatment.\n5. Improved drug design: A deeper understanding of the three-dimensional structure of proteins and other biomolecules is critical for developing effective drugs. Statistical models can help to identify promising drug targets and predict their effectiveness, leading to more efficient drug discovery and development.\n6. Broader applications: The techniques developed for analyzing cryo-EM images can be applied to other areas of biomedical research,\nQuestion:What were the specific algorithms used for comparison with the Bayesian network-based models in the evaluation? Can you provide details on the experimental setup and methodology used for comparing performance?)\nAnswer:Sure!

  "Bitcoin payment processing isn't widespread by any means, but if PayPal is considering it the way president David Marcus says they are, then BTC just might go mainstream.\n\nIn a recent Bloomberg interview, Marcus explained his stance on the wayward currency:\n\nSo I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time looking at it, and it\u2019s truly fascinating actually: the way that the currency\u2019s been designed, and the way that inflation is built in to pay for miners, and all that is truly fascinating. I think that for us at PayPal, it\u2019s just a question whether Bitcoin will make its way to PayPal\u2019s funding instrument or not. We\u2019re kinda thinking about it.\n\nPayPal's role in getting Bitcoin off the ground cannot be understated. The company is notorious for draconian measures that block all kinds of cyber payments, the very reason Bitcoin has managed to succeed in different markets. But it wouldn't take much for PayPal, like Western Union or MoneyGram, to exchange BTC for local currency. The systems are in place, it's only a matter of whether PayPal is willing to work with sites that use Bitcoin regardless of prior restrictions. If so, Bitcoin's user base stands to grow immensely, while the currency could become integral to online auctions, and retail in general. On a site like eBay, for example, Bitcoin could become the core unit of monetary exchange. But if not, Bitcoin could find itself without a large user base or many sites to turn to.\n\nWe can't assume Bitcoin is all for joining ranks with PayPal, or that PayPal is keen to process it (yet). Historically, PayPal has been wary of any currency it can't defraud, and without the backing of banks, that's very hard to do with Bitcoin. And for its part, Bitcoin isn't so keen on getting tied up a money-transfer service like PayPal, which to them, is just part of America's problem\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

  "\\section{Introduction}\n\n\nMachine learning models depend drastically on the data quality and its amount. In many cases, using more data allows the model to reveal hidden patterns deeper and achieve better prediction accuracy~\\cite{Sun_2017_ICCV}. However, gathering of a high-quality labeled dataset is a time-consuming and expensive process~\\cite{data2019automating}.\nMoreover, it is not always possible to obtain additional data: in many tasks, unique or rare objects are considered~\\cite{Nesteruk2021Image_Compression} or access to the objects is restricted~\\cite{HUANG2019372}. In other tasks, we should gather data rapidly~\\cite{shadrin-2020}. The following tasks are among such challenges: operational damage assessment in emergency situations~\\cite{novikov2018satellite}, medical image classification~\\cite{masquelin2021wavelet}. There are different approaches to address dataset limitations: pseudo labeling, special architectures development, transfer learning~\\cite{zhang2015initialize},~\\cite{bullock2019xnet},~\\cite{barz2020deep},~\\cite{ng2015deep}. \nAnother standard method to address this issue is image augmentation. Augmentation means applying transformations (such as flip, rotate, scale, change brightness and contrast) to the original images to increase the size of the dataset~\\cite{info11020125}. \n\nIn this study, we focus on augmentation techniques for the remote sensing domain. Lack of labeled data for particular remote sensing tasks makes it crucial to generate more training samples artificially and prevent overfitting~\\cite{8113128}. However, simple color and geometrical transformations fail to meet all geospatial demands. The goal of this work is to propose an object-based augmentation~(OBA) pipeline for the semantic segmentation task that works with high-resolution georeferenced satellite images. Naming our augmentation methodology object-based, we imply that this technique targets separate objects instead of whole images. The idea behind the approach is to crop objects from original images using their masks and pasting them to a new background. Every object and background can be augmented independently to increase the variability of training images; shadows for pasted objects also can be added artificially\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 7 sentences.

If the primary usage is casual browsing, email, social media, and other web-based activities, then a Chromebook could be an excellent choice due to its fast boot times, built-in virus protection, and automatic updates. The low price point also makes it a great option for basic daily use.\nHowever, if the intended usage requires high processing power, advanced hardware specifications, specialized software, or compatibility issues with certain tools and programs, then a MacBook Pro or Windows laptop may be necessary. These systems offer better performance and flexibility but come at a higher cost, both financially and in terms of space and maintenance. Users should evaluate their needs and weigh the pros and cons before making a decision.\nIn summary, while the limitations of Chromebooks may not make them suitable for every scenario, users should carefully evaluate their unique needs and requirements before committing to a purchase.)\nAnswer the question step by step and explain your thoughts.

Researchers employ\nAnswer:One way that astronomers account for the presence of an AGN when measuring the central stellar surface density of galaxies is by making corrections to the observed brightness profile based on what we know about black holes and their surroundings in the universe. An AGN will likely affect both the brightness and geometry of the surrounding stellar populations due to gravitational attraction from the massive central object and its intense radiation output.\nThis correction requires modelling the effect of an AGN on the stellar component using numerical techniques, taking into account factors like accretion rate, angular momentum distribution, and orbital dynamics within the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH).\n\nThese corrections allow us to tease out signals originating directly from starlight versus those contaminated by the influence of the AGN. Once corrected, astronomers can proceed with inferring key structural parameters such as the total mass and scale length of the host galaxy, and assess the distribution of its central stellar density with respect to the underlying structure and assembly history.\n\nAsk a single relevant and insightful question about the preceding context and previous questions.

  "\\section{Introduction}\\label{s1}\nIn this paper, we consider distributed optimization problems where the goal is to minimize a sum of objective functions over a multi-agent network. Formally, we consider a decision variable,~$\\mb{z}\\in\\mbb{R}^p$, and a strongly-connected network containing~$n$ agents, where each agent,~$i$, only has access to a local objective function,~$f_i:\\mbb{R}^p\\rightarrow\\mbb{R}$. The goal is to have each  agent minimize the sum of objectives,~$\\sum_{i=1}^nf_i(\\mb{z})$, via information exchange with the neighbors. This formulation has gained great interest due to its widespread applications in, e.g., large-scale machine learning,~\\cite{distributed_Boyd,ml}, model-predictive control,~\\cite{distributed_Necoara}, cognitive networks,~\\cite{distributed_Mateos,distributed_Bazerque}, source localization,~\\cite{distributed_Rabbit,distributed_Khan}, resource scheduling,~\\cite{distributed_Chunlin}, and message routing,~\\cite{distributed_Neglia}.\n\nMost of the existing algorithms assume information exchange over undirected networks (graphs), where the communication between the agents is bidirectional, i.e., if agent~$i$ sends information to agent~$j$ then agent~$j$ can also send information to agent~$i$. Related work includes Distributed Gradient Descent (DGD),~\\cite{uc_Nedic,cc_nedic,cc_Lobel2,cc_Ram2}, which achieves~$O(\\frac{\\ln k}{\\sqrt{k}})$ convergence for arbitrary convex functions, and~$O(\\frac{\\ln k}{k})$ for strongly-convex functions, where~$k$ is the number of iterations. The convergence rates can be accelerated with an additional Lipschitz-continuity assumption on  the associated gradient. For example, see DGD~\\cite{DGD_Yuan} that converges at~$O(\\frac{1}{k})$ for general convex functions but within a ball around the optimal solution, whereas, it converges linearly to the optimal solution for strongly-convex functions. The distributed Nestrov's method,~\\cite{fast_Gradient}, converges at~$O(\\frac{\\ln k}{k^2})$ for general convex functions. Of significant relevance is EXTRA,~\\cite{EXTRA}, which converges to the optimal solution at~$O(\\frac{1}{k})$ for general convex functions and is linear for strongly-convex functions. The work in \\cite{Augmented_EXTRA} improves EXTRA by relaxing the weight matrices to be asymmetric. Besides the gradient-based methods, the distributed implementation of ADMM,~\\cite{ADMM_Mota,ADMM_Wei, ADMM_Shi}, has also been considered over undirected graphs. \n\n\nThe aforementioned methods,~\\cite{uc_Nedic,cc_nedic,cc_Lobel2,cc_Ram2,DGD_Yuan,fast_Gradient,EXTRA,Augmented_EXTRA,ADMM_Mota,ADMM_Wei, ADMM_Shi}, are applicable to undirected graphs that allow the use of doubly-stochastic weight matrices; row-stochasticity guarantees that all agents reach consensus, while the column-stochasticity ensures that each local gradient contributes equally to the global objective,~\\cite{D-DGD}\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 4 sentences.

  "Coffee chain Starbucks has begun asking its UK customers their names in a bid to appear more friendly. But do people really want to be on first name terms with their barista?\n\nJust got your head around waiting in line and remembering whether you ordered a grande flavoured latte, a tall caramel macchiato or a venti mocha light frappuccino?\n\nScrap that. Starbucks wants to get back to basics.\n\n\"Have you noticed how everything seems a little impersonal nowadays?\", its website asks wistfully. \"We've all become user names, reference numbers and IP addresses.\n\n\"From now on, we won't refer to you as a 'latte' or a 'mocha', but instead as your folks intended: by your name,\" the coffee chain claims.\n\nFrom now, as well as taking orders from customers, baristas will also ask what they are called so this can be scribbled on cups and called out when coffees are ready for collection.\n\nAll sounds very American? That is because it is.\n\nBut across the Atlantic, where the policy has been in place for years, Starbucks' friendliness has not always been reciprocated.\n\nA cursory internet search throws up entire blogs dedicated to snaps of shoddy spelling and miswritten names on the firm's receptacles.\n\nTwitter reaction When the barista in Starbucks asks you your name so they can write it on your free latte, I dare you to say 'Costa' -@martinsaunders\n\nSo Starbucks is giving away coffee if you tell them your name. Who's got the best fake Starbucks name? Anyone told them your name's Robocop? -@DonnaBow\n\nThe whole Starbucks name thing is a real test for my paranoia. I now need an alias for buying coffee -@PoppyD\n\nWhat will staff in Starbucks do if public refuse to give name? Not serve, stand like broken automata, cry? -@phuplate\n\n\"Starbucks: Where no one knows your name,\" declares one. A practice employed to enhance brand loyalty presumably has the opposite effect when Pat is Tad, Jim turns into Tim and Margaret becomes Margrit.\n\n\"That's not my name, Starbucks,\" laments another - although many people see the funny side of their alter ego.\n\n\"Accents are tricky,\" sympathises contributor Paul Carr, of his new name Pole. \"This is how you spell my name if you want to say it with a sexy voice,\" Cory says of Corres. \"Haha I think it's a compliment\", Nathalie says of Wow.\n\nThe temptation to try Bart Simpson's trick of making up fake rude names to raise a smile is also well documented.\n\nSo will the British embrace Starbucks' new-found familiarity, find it funny, or should the coffee chain be bracing itself for a backlash?\n\nIf comedian Arthur Smith, star of TV's Grumpy Old Men, is anything to go on, the brand might be in for a bumpy ride.\n\n\"I am not looking to make friends when I go into a coffee shop, I just want a drink,\" he complains.\n\nImage caption Some drinkers are determined to withhold their identities from baristas\n\n\"I want a pleasant but respectful distance between me and the person serving me coffee - I don't want to go clubbing with them.\"\n\nCertainly, initial reactions on Twitter were polarised.\n\nWhile some were enthusiastic about Starbucks' offer of free coffee to promote the policy change, others were determined to humorously subvert what they saw as a breach of the implicit barista-customer relationship.\n\nThe latter is a sentiment that Chris Hackley, professor of marketing at Royal Holloway, University of London, believes many customers will share - particularly those who visit Starbucks' cafes in order to work, or to find a bit of solitary peace and quiet.\n\n\"Some people might like being called by their first name, but I think many will be indifferent, and some might feel awkward - like it's over-familiar, or a bit of an intrusion into privacy,\" he says\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 6 sentences.

I'll be happy to answer this question about NLProlog and how it compares to traditional Natural Language Understanding (NLU) approaches.\n\nAdvantage 1: Handling Longer-Term Dependencies and Relationships\nTraditional NLU approaches have difficulty handling long-range dependencies between words or phrases in a sentence. This is because they rely on shallow models that only look at nearby context, rather than taking into account the overall structure of the text. In contrast, NLProlog uses a deeper semantic analysis based on logical rules, which allows it to capture these longer-term dependencies and relationships more effectively.\n\nAdvantage 2: Improving Performance with Prior Knowledge\nTraditional NLU systems often need to retrain their models from scratch every time new data becomes available, which can be slow and expensive. NLProlog, on the other hand, has the advantage of being able to leverage existing prior knowledge to improve its performance. For example, it can incorporate background information from encyclopedias, dictionaries, or expertise-specific literature, allowing it to make better predictions with less data.\n\nAdvantage 3: Partially Explained Decisions\nOne disadvantage of traditional NLU systems is that they can be difficult to understand and interpret. They may provide accurate results, but it can be hard to see why they made those decisions. In contrast, NLProlog provides a partial explanation for each decision it makes, based on the rules and facts it used to arrive at that conclusion. This transparency can help users better understand the model's behavior and correct any mistakes if necessary.\n\nAdvantage 4: Integrating Multiple Sources of Input\nIn real-world applications, natural language data is\n\nAsk a single relevant and insightful question about the preceding context and previous questions.

Multilingual Support: I can understand and respond to queries in multiple languages, making me useful for users who speak languages other than the dominant\nAnswer:To create models that are truly objective and free from bias, the following steps must be followed:\n\n1. Collecting a large and diverse dataset: The larger the dataset, the less likely it is to be skewed towards one side or another. Diversity in terms of geography, demographics, and types of events will also reduce the risk of introducing unwanted biases.\n2. Preprocessing and cleaning the data: This includes removing irrelevant or missing values, transforming categorical variables into numerical form, handling missing values, and checking for anomalies and outliers. Cleaning the data ensures that it reflects reality as closely as possible.\n3. Feature selection: Choosing the most important features from the dataset that contribute the most to the prediction task while avoiding overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model learns too much detail from the training data, resulting in poor generalization to new data. Feature selection minimizes this problem.\n4. Model selection: Evaluate different machine learning algorithms to determine which performs best on the dataset. This involves tuning hyperparameters and testing different architectures to choose the optimal configuration.\n5. Validation and cross-validation: Split the dataset into training and test sets to evaluate the performance of the chosen algorithm and hyperparameter settings. Cross-validation further validates the results by splitting the dataset multiple times and measuring the accuracy on both training and test sets.\n6. Regularization: Apply regularization techniques such as L1 and L2 penalties to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model generalizes well to new data.\n\nQuestion:How can organizations strike a balance between leveraging customer data for personalization and ensuring data privacy to avoid potential backlash?\n\n Organizations can strike a balance by implementing transparent data collection practices, obtaining explicit consent from customers, and providing clear information on how their data will be used. They should also invest in robust security measures to protect customer information and regularly audit their systems for any vulnerabilities. Additionally, organizations can offer customers control over their data by providing options to opt-out or limit the use of their personal information. By prioritizing transparency, consent, security, and customer control, organizations can navigate the fine line between personalization and privacy concerns effectively.\nAnswer the question step by step and explain your thoughts.

  "1 of 1 2 of 1\n\nIn a statement on June 11, Canadian health minister Rona Ambrose reacted strongly to the Supreme Court ruling that medical cannabis should be available in all forms to patients using it for medical purposes. Not only is Ambrose \u201coutraged\u201d, she believes that it sends a message of normalization to Canadian youth and that there is no clear evidence on the efficacy of cannabis for medical purposes.\n\nBut she\u2019s wrong.\n\nIt\u2019s troubling that the health minister of Canada, a voice that is suppose to serve the public health interest of Canadians, still cannot admit that cannabis can be, and is, used for a variety of medical purposes.\n\nWe should also be concerned that our health minister is having trouble with a decision made in the highest court of Canada. In a unanimous decision (7-0) effective immediately, the judges agreed that it was unreasonable to require users to smoke dried marijuana and that Canadians should not have to choose between their liberty and their health.\n\nDoes that mean our constitutional rights simply don\u2019t matter to Ambrose? Let\u2019s not forget that the Harper government appointed seven of the nine judges of the Supreme Court of Canada. It\u2019s frightening that our health minister not only lacks understanding of Canadian\u2019s constitutional rights, but that she outright refuses to become better educated about cannabis as a medicine. Instead, she\u2019d rather sit with her eyes and ears closed reaffirming that \u201ccannabis is not a medicine\u201d!\n\nIf that were me in Ambrose\u2019s position, I\u2019d want to see the research too. Part of the job description entails the promotion and protection of public health. Unfortunately, her opinion is not based on current evidence, but century-old \u201creefer madness\u201d propaganda that is really out of touch with current science. In fact, there are many credible institutions in North America producing peer-reviewed studies on cannabis\u2014from the science to the sociology\u2014and even more when we look to international leaders in this type of research, such as Israel and Spain. Even many of the current producers licensed under the federal program have made a trip to Israel to see what types of innovations are happening there in the medical cannabis world.\n\nKirk Tousaw, the lawyer responsible for winning this case, said in a recent CBC News interview that Ambrose should \u201cgo back to her desk, and get to work on crafting a reasonable set of regulations that will stand up to charter scrutiny, that\u2019s her job\u201d. And he\u2019s right. In Canada, it seems the judicial system is the only real way to make meaningful change\u2014the entire medical cannabis program was a right won in the courts.\n\nWe can\u2019t forget about the children, says Ambrose, arguing that medical access in other forms will make pot seem \u201cnormal\u201d to them. What about seven-year-old Liam McKnight with Dravet syndrome, whose mother has been breaking the law for nearly two years to provide cannabis in oil form to her son to manage his seizures? Or three-year-old Gwenevere Repetski who relies on the oil to manage her epilepsy? Does the health minister of Canada believe these children should smoke their medicine, or that their parents should be criminalized for extracting cannabis into oil form?\n\nTo deny the experience of many Canadians without any proper education certainly seems to have become commonplace for the Harper government\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 4 sentences.

He would certainly fall into that category.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of the ability to capture an individual,\u201d Burr continued, \u201cif they are involved operationally in terrorism in a way that would put Americans\u2019 lives in jeopardy or security domestically in question, then I believe we have an obligation to eliminate that threat and there are times where we make decisions that individuals are geographically located in a place that we can\u2019t get to them.\u201d\n\nHe cited problems of sovereignty issues and the risk of putting \u201ctoo many lives in jeopardy\u201d to try to capture a suspect.\n\nAl Farekh was captured by Pakistani forces and faces trial in the United States.\n\n\u201cWhether there\u2019s any intelligence value there, that\u2019s up to the experts to determine,\u201d Burr said.\n\nHe declined to comment on the CIA\u2019s covert drone strike program or confirm its existence, but said: \u201cI think the methods we use around the world are effective at disrupting and eliminating the leadership of terrorist organizations.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe we do an incredibly effective oversight job on all of the CIA\u2019s programs,\u201d Burr said. \u201cAnd there is no program that receives the level of oversight as the ones we carry out in Pakistan\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

Conflicts may cause delays, deadlocks, or even data corruption, resulting in degraded performance and potential loss of productivity.\n3. Suggest some best practices to address concurrency concerns: To mitigate concurrency issues while working with large datasets, several strategies can be employed:\na. Locking mechanisms: Implement row-level locking or page-level locking to ensure that only one user can update a particular record or page at a time. This prevents conflicting updates but may decrease overall throughput and increase contention points.\nb. Pessimistic locking: Choose pessimistic locking if your application requires stronger consistency guarantees. With pessimistic locking, a client holds exclusive access to a shared resource until its transaction completes, ensuring serializability but potentially increasing blocking times.\nc. Optimistic locking: Prefer optimistic locking if your application tolerates eventual consistency. Clients can perform read/write operations without holding locks, assuming that conflicts are rare and can be resolved later.

  "The Melting Pot Theatre Programme for The Melting Pot (1916). Written by Israel Zangwill Characters David Quixano Date premiered 1908\n\nThe Melting Pot is a play by Israel Zangwill, first staged in 1908. It depicts the life of a Russian Jewish immigrant family, the Quixanos. David Quixano has survived a pogrom, which killed his mother and sister, and he wishes to forget this horrible event. He composes an \"American Symphony\" and wants to look forward to a society free of ethnic divisions and hatred, rather than backward at his traumatic past.\n\nPlot [ edit ]\n\nDavid Quixano emigrates to America in the wake of the 1903 Kishinev pogrom in which his entire family is killed. He writes a great symphony called \"The Crucible\" expressing his hope for a world in which all ethnicity has melted away, and falls in love with a beautiful Russian Christian immigrant named Vera. The dramatic peak of the play is the moment when David meets Vera's father, who turns out to be the Russian officer responsible for the annihilation of David's family. Vera's father admits his guilt, the symphony is performed to accolades, David and Vera agree to wed and kiss as the curtain falls.\n\nTitle [ edit ]\n\nDavid, the hero, proclaims:\n\nThere she lies, the great Melting Pot\u2014listen!

Here shall they all unite to build the Republic of Man and the Kingdom of God. Ah, Vera, what is the glory of Rome and Jerusalem where all nations and races come to worship and look back, compared with the glory of America, where all races and nations come to labour and look forward![1]\n\nAlthough the idea of \"melting\" as a metaphor for ethnic assimilation had been used before, Zangwill's play popularized the term \"melting pot\" as a symbol for this occurrence in American society.[2]\n\nEarly productions [ edit ]\n\nThe Melting Pot opened in Washington, DC, on October 5, 1908. President Theodore Roosevelt, in attendance that night, is said to have shouted \"That's a great play, Mr. Zangwill\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 6 sentences.

  "\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sect:intro} \n\nHitomi (ASTRO-H)~\\citenum{Tak18}, developed based on an\ninternational collaboration led by ISAS/JAXA in Japan, was\nlaunched on February 17, 2016. Hitomi carries two types of\nX-ray telescopes; one is the Soft X-ray Telescope\n(SXT)~\\citenum{Soo11} that focuses X-rays below 10~keV, and\nthe other is the Hard X-ray Telescope (HXT)~\\citenum{Awa14}\nthat can focus X-rays up to 80~keV. The HXT adopts a conical\napproximation to the Wolter-I optics design\nwith a focal length of 12~m. Thin foils of aluminum\nwith a thickness of 0.2~mm and a height of 200~mm are used\nas reflector substrates.  The radius of the innermost\nreflector is 60~mm, and that of the outermost reflector is\n225~mm.  The surface of the foils is covered with a\nmultilayer of platinum and carbon to reflect hard X-rays by\nBragg reflection. The total number of nesting shells is 213,\nand the aperture is divided into three segments along the\nazimuthal direction.  Since the HXT utilizes two-stage\nreflection, the total number of reflectors is $213 \\times 3\n\\times 2 = 1278$. There are 14 kinds of multilayers that are\napplied to the HXT, and the details of the design is\ndescribed in Awaki et al. (2014)~\\citenum{Awa14} and Tamura et\nal. (2018)~\\citenum{Tam18}.

  "\\section{Introduction}\n\t\\label{sec_introduction}\n\t\n\tA Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) arises after an ultra relativistic collimated jet breaks out from a dense medium, be it a star in long GRBs (lGRBs) or, presumably, a Neutron star merger ejecta in short GRBs (sGRBs). \n\tIn both cases the jet has to successfully cross the circumventing medium before it can form a GRB. As it propagates through the medium the jet drives a bow shock ahead of it, behind which a cocoon of shocked matter is formed. The cocoon applies pressure on the jet, collimates it and facilitates its passage through the medium. The jet, and the cocoon that engulfs it, interact with each other as they co-evolve. This interaction plays a crucial role in shaping the morphology of the jet and the cocoon, both inside the dense medium and after breaking out of it.\n\t\n\tThe post-breakout structure ultimately governs the observational imprint of the jet from the prompt emission to the afterglow, thus, characterizing it is of a great interest.\n\tIn most models that can be found in the literature the jet structure is assumed to be top-hat. Namely, the jet is considered to have uniform distributions of Lorentz factor and power within a given opening angle and zero outside. While such a model could be sometimes satisfactory for jets that are observed from directions within the jet cone, it is highly unlikely to be sufficient for ``off-axis\" observers located at large viewing angles from the axis. \n\tRecent observations of GRB170817 indicated that the jet was viewed at an offset of $ \\sim 20^\\circ $ from the axis \\citep{Mooley2018b}. Based on these and other afterglow observations it was confirmed that jets are likely to have a more complex structure, often referred to as ``structured jet\" \\citep[e.g.][see \\citealt{Nakar2019} for a review of GW170817 and more references therein]{Alexander2018,Dobie2018,Fong2019,Ghirlanda2019,Hajela2019,Mooley2018a,Mooley2018b,Mooley2018c,Troja2019,Wu2019}. This structure has a profound effect on the observed emission at angles larger than the jet opening angle.\n\t\n\tThe structure of the jet is often assumed to have a characteristic angular dependent structure (e.g\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 6 sentences.

  "For the past 36 years Frank Marks has accumulated thousands of hours probing the hearts and souls of hurricanes, getting to know them from their birth to their death. Now Hurricane Matthew, the first major cyclone to hit the U.S. mainland in 11 years\u2014is giving him still more quality time with a monster. Marks\u2014meteorologist and director of the Hurricane Research\n\nDivision at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory\u2014has been flying into the storm for the past several days and nights, along with some 18 other scientists, pilots, navigators and engineers. Every 12 hours they fly stretches of six to eight hours aboard one of NOAA\u2019s P-3 Orion aircraft, recently refurbished with new wings and engines.\n\nThey use the four-engine turboprop airplane as a huge stethoscope to monitor Matthew\u2019s vital signs. In these, as in larger NASA hurricane-hunter aircraft (such as a DC-8 used to study the genesis of the storms) each researcher sits before a console, a computer screen or a laptop mounted on metal racks where there used to be passenger seats. The screens show the flight profile as well as what the storm is doing in real time. Other monitors show rows of changing numbers reflecting the activity of the high-tech instruments connected to the outer fuselage of the aircraft: Doppler radars, microwave sensors, lidars, dropsondes, water vapor and aerosols spectrometers, and a suite of tubes to sample air, salt and dust particles, ice crystals and water drops.\n\nMeanwhile the cockpit is minding its own business. Pilots with good stomachs and steel nerves like Commander Justin Kibbey have to thread their way in and out of the eye, constantly passing through the calm-and-turbulence patterns typical of the galaxy-shaped storms. By now Kibbey and his colleagues are unperturbed by the constant barrage of emergency lights and computer messages\u2014any one of which might make any commercial flight divert to the nearest airport.\n\n\u201cWe are out there for situational awareness: knowing what is going on now,\u201d Marks tells Scientific American. \u201cOur job is to collect as many observations as we can to send to the National Hurricane Center in Miami, and to NOAA\u2019s numerical models center in Washington.\u201d And those models must be continually fed with new data as the storm advances. \u201cEvery six hours we put fresh data into each one of those runs, so that the models start the best way possible,\u201d Marks explains.\n\nNOAA's Orion P-3 in its Tampa MacDicc Air Force Base hangar. Credit: J. Cozic, NOAA\n\nThis is why, Marks adds, it is so crucial to actually go inside the hurricane. NOAA\u2019s storm behavior models can use satellite data, but that has many limitations because clouds obscure the sea surface. The storm-chasing aircraft\u2019s new scatterometer\u2014a microwave radar sensor that measures the reflection (or scattering effect) produced while scanning the surface of the Earth\u2014can see inside the storm with high resolution, something akin to a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Also new this season is an airborne Doppler radar, which offers \u201cthree-dimensional snapshots of the winds to show hurricane specialists what the hurricane structure looks like with height, which tells us something about how it\u2019s interacting with the vertical wind shear.\u201d\n\nThis weekend\u2019s missions are especially interesting for Marks because he will be deploying a new winged dropsonde for the first time in a strong storm. Called Coyote, it is a small motorized drone that is launched with its wings folded through an opening in the fuselage. It can fly for about one and a half hours, and according to Marks it is part of a new generation of instruments that are controlled by a pilot from a laptop on board the P-3. In 2014 it was deployed into Hurricane Edouard as a demonstration. \u201cBut this is the first time we deploy it in a major storm,\u201d Marks says\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 4 sentences.

  "\n\n\\section*{Appendix}\n\n\\section*{Multi-hop Prover Details}\nProlog is a logic programming language that consists of a set of predicates. A predicate has a name (functor) and a set of $N > 0$ arguments. For example, \\prologTerm{get(i, work, on\\_time)} is a predicate with functor \\prologTerm{get} and 3 arguments. Predicates are defined by a set of logical rules or Horn clauses (\\prologTerm{$\\text{Head} \\coloneq \\text{Body}$}) and facts (\\prologTerm{$\\text{Head}$}), where \\prologTerm{Head} is a predicate, \\prologTerm{Body} is a conjunction of predicates, and \\prologTerm{$\\coloneq$} is logical implication. Prolog uses backward-chaining to logically reason about (prove) an input query, represented by a predicate. From a high level, a proof consists of a chain of logical facts and rules available in the background KB. Inspired by this prover, we extend this to free-form text proofs in this paper.\n\nThis chain-structured definition of a proof is inspired by a Prolog proof. A knowledge tuple here is analogous to a logical rule in Prolog (\\prologTerm{Head $\\coloneq$ Body}) where the \\emph{subject} and \\emph{object} correspond to either the \\prologTerm{Body}, or the \\prologTerm{Head} depending on the  \\emph{relation}. We categorize $\\mathbb{COMET}$~\\emph{relation}s into two classes, namely pre-conditions and post-effects. If the \\emph{relation} is a post-effect, the \\emph{object} is the \\prologTerm{Head} and the \\emph{subject} is the \\prologTerm{Body}. If the \\emph{relation} is a pre-condition, the reverse is true. For example, the relations ``Because I wanted'' and ``is used for'' in Fig~\\ref{fig:comet} are post-effects, whereas the relations ``Before I needed'' and ``requires action'' are pre-conditions.\nThe \\emph{subject} (\\prologTerm{Body}) consists of a single predicate (instead of a conjunction of predicates in Prolog). Since there is no conjunction in the \\prologTerm{Body} of the rules, the logical proof reduces to a chain (as opposed to a proof tree in Prolog). Moreover, the semantic closeness of $o_{i-1}$ and $s_i$ is inspired by the unification operation \\cite{colmerauer1990introduction} in Prolog and is analogous to the soft unification operation of CORGI's neuro-symbolic theorem prover.\nIt is worth noting that this analogue falls short of Prolog's variable grounding and is an interesting avenue for our future work.\n\n\n\\section*{Dialogue System Details}\nThe control flow of \\varmathbb{CLUE}'s dialog system in Figure \\ref{fig:CLUE_diagram} is shown in detail in Figure \\ref{fig:control_flow}. The dialog system uses the logic templates and the results returned by $\\mathbb{COMET}${} to interact with the human user and ask questions.\n\n\\input{dialog_fig}\n\nFor example, consider proving the first implication of the blue template (\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\blueTemplate{$\\neg$ {\\fontfamily{lmtt}\\selectfont goal\\,} $\\coloneq$ {\\fontfamily{lmtt}\\selectfont state\\,}}) for the command ``If it snows tonight then wake me up early because I want to get to work on time''. \\varmathbb{CLUE}~first tries to find the negation of the {\\fontfamily{lmtt}\\selectfont goal\\,} (get to work on time) by querying $\\mathbb{COMET}$$(r, \\text{{\\fontfamily{lmtt}\\selectfont goal\\,}})$ for relations ($r$) indicating negation (such as \\emph{NotCapableOf} and \\emph{NotIsA}). \\varmathbb{CLUE}~then picks the highest ranking returned $\\mathbb{COMET}$~statement (I am late) and asks the user ``is $\\langle \\neg$ {\\fontfamily{lmtt}\\selectfont goal\\,} $\\rangle$ the opposite of $\\langle$ {\\fontfamily{lmtt}\\selectfont goal\\,} $\\rangle$?(y/n)'' (Is ``I am late'' the opposite of ``I get to work on time''?(y/n)). If the user responds `yes', then \\varmathbb{CLUE}~asks ``what does $\\langle$ {\\fontfamily{lmtt}\\selectfont state\\,} $\\rangle$ cause that leads to $\\langle \\neg$ {\\fontfamily{lmtt}\\selectfont goal\\,} $\\rangle$?'' (what does ``it snows tonight'' cause that leads to ``I am late''?) and expects an explanation from the user in response. If the user responds `no' to the first question, then \\varmathbb{CLUE}~asks ``what does $\\langle$ {\\fontfamily{lmtt}\\selectfont state\\,} $\\rangle$ cause that makes it difficult to achieve $\\langle$ {\\fontfamily{lmtt}\\selectfont goal\\,} $\\rangle$?'' (What does ``it snows tonight'' cause that makes it difficult to achieve ``I get to work on time''?) and expects an explanation from the user in response. The reason for querying $\\mathbb{COMET}$~for the negated {\\fontfamily{lmtt}\\selectfont goal\\,}~is that negation in Prolog is implemented based on negation as failure. Therefore, to be consistent, \\varmathbb{CLUE}~converts the {\\fontfamily{lmtt}\\selectfont goal\\,} to its negated statement and proves that instead.\n\n\\section*{Extended Experiments}\n\n\\input{half_proofs_table}\n\nTables \\ref{tab:half_proof_ex_p1} and \\ref{tab:half_proof_ex_p2} show 32 examples of the 67 expert-verified half-proofs reported in Table \\ref{tab:n_hop}. These half-proofs are obtained using bidirectional 2-hop beam search and logically prove the {\\fontfamily{lmtt}\\selectfont goal\\,} $\\coloneq$ {\\fontfamily{lmtt}\\selectfont action\\,} implication. Recall that {\\fontfamily{lmtt}\\selectfont action\\,} refers to the Then-portion of the command and {\\fontfamily{lmtt}\\selectfont goal\\,} refers to the Because-portion of the command. The embeddings used to measure semantic closeness in the prover is GloVe\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences. Do not try to create questions or answers for your summarization.\n\n",

An example might be a medical condition that has both physical symptoms (e.g., fever) and mental health components (e.g., anxiety). This condition could be categorized separately in two different entity taxonomies - one for physical conditions and one for mental health conditions. \nFinally, there's the possibility of no direct relationship at all, especially when taxonomies focus on very different types of entities.

  "\\section*{Introduction}\n$\\mathbb{COMET}$\\footnote{Commonsense-Oriented Monotonicity-preserving Entity Taxonomy} provides simple statements in natural language, allowing the reasoning behind the relation to determine if the statements are correct or useful information provided for the reasoning process. The statements have different roles such as entities like dates, times, states, or events, which may or may not occur in the premises leading up to them, or conditions that influence the premise occurrence itself...\\section*{Methods}\nPrevious Question \nQuestion:Can you clarify how these entity taxonomies relate to each other? \nThe above method does not return answers; it only assists with better understanding through asking questions based on context. This enables further discussion by providing an opportunity to expand on specific aspects or points of interest without being overwhelmed with information or misinterpretation.\nAnswer:Certainly! In terms of relationships between entity taxonomies, there are several possible ways they can be related. One common relationship is subordination, where one taxonomy contains all the entities found within another taxonomy. For example, consider a taxonomy of fruits that includes apple, banana, orange, and pineapple. A separate taxonomy of plants could contain all four of those fruits, with apple, banana, and pineapple falling under \"Fruit\" as their broader category, while orange would fall under both \"fruit\" and \"Orange tree.\"\nAnother type of relationship is overlap, where some entities appear in multiple taxonomies. An example might be a medical condition that has both physical symptoms (e.g., fever) and mental health components (e.g., anxiety). This condition could be categorized separately in two different entity taxonomies - one for physical conditions and one for mental health conditions. \nFinally, there's the possibility of no direct relationship at all, especially when taxonomies focus on very different types of entities. For instance, a taxonomy of animals could be unrelated to a taxonomy of buildings, despite having similar concepts like size and location that could lead to overlap in some cases.\nQuestion:Continuing on the example from before, if I was to ask what type of fruit do you prefer?

  "Suppressing bad memories from the past can block memory formation in the here and now, research suggests.\n\nThe study could help to explain why those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other psychological conditions often experience difficulty in remembering recent events, scientists say.\n\nWriting in Nature Communications, the authors describe how trying to forget past incidents by suppressing our recollections can create a \u201cvirtual lesion\u201d in the brain that casts an \u201camnesiac shadow\u201d over the formation of new memories. \u201cIf you are motivated to try to prevent yourself from reliving a flashback of that initial trauma, anything that you experience around the period of time of suppression tends to get sucked up into this black hole as well,\u201d Dr Justin Hulbert, one of the study\u2019s authors, told the Guardian.\n\nSelf-control saps memory resources Read more\n\n\u201cI think it makes perfect sense because we know that people with a wide range of psychological problems have difficulties with their everyday memories for ordinary events,\u201d said Professor Chris Brewin, an expert in PTSD from University College, London, who was not involved in the study. \u201cPotentially this could account for the memory deficits we find in depression and other disorders too.\u201d\n\nThe phenomenon came to the attention of the scientists during a lecture when a student admitted to having suffered bouts of amnesia after witnessing the 1999 Columbine high school massacre. When the student returned to the school for classes after the incident she found she could not remember anything from the lessons she was in. \u201cHere she was surrounded by all these reminders of these terrible things that she preferred not to think about,\u201d said Hulbert.\n\nThe student\u2019s account raised an intriguing possibility. Previous studies had revealed that the suppression of memories is linked to a decrease in activity in the hippocampus - the area of the brain involved with making new memories and retrieving old ones. \u201cIt occurred to us that this student\u2019s experience may very well be a side-effect of the very thing we had discovered only a couple of years earlier,\u201d said Professor Michael Anderson, a co-author of the research. \u201cThere is a trade-off: you get rid of the memories you don\u2019t want, but you also make your memory less effective for short windows of time.\u201d\n\nTo probe the theory, researchers at Bard College, New York, the UK\u2019s Medical Research Council and the University of Cambridge subjected 381 healthy participants to a series of memory tests.\n\nIn the first test, participants were shown to pairs of words which had a loose relation to each other, such as \u201cballet\u201d and \u201cleap\u201d and were asked to learn them. They were then shown one of the words, and asked either to recall or suppress the memory of the second word. Such suppression, however, required practice. \u201cOne simple strategy is focusing on the cue word on the screen,\u201d Hulbert explained. \u201cSo they might look at how many vowels are in the word or whether the word is pleasing to look at or not.\u201d\n\nLater in the task, participants were then shown an image of an object in an unusual setting, such as a peacock in a car park, and asked to construct a story in their minds about the scenario, before being asked again to either recall or suppress the memory of a word associated with a cue.\n\nBritish scientists win world's biggest neuroscience prize for work on memory Read more\n\nFollowing a string of such exercises, participants were then asked to recall the object in each image\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

  "If you\u2019ve tried to use JavaScript in a functional style, you\u2019ve no doubt chafed at the fact that all those little objects flying around at any given time are about as far as they can possibly get from immutable. You can, of course, be careful to write code that never mutates an object, but while good practices improve your code, they\u2019re weak defenses against bugs.\n\nTypeScript can help you with its readonly property modifier. With readonly , you can rely on TypeScript\u2019s static analysis to enforce and flag mutations in your codebase.\n\nThe readonly property modifier has a similar effect on properties to what const does with variables: It prohibits you from redefining a property on an object to have something else.\n\ntype Foo = { bar: string }; const x: Foo = {bar: 'baz'}; x.bar = 'quux'; // allowed type ReadonlyFoo = { readonly bar: string }; const y: ReadonlyFoo = {bar: 'baz'}; y.bar = 'quux'; // disallowed\n\nBut, again much like const , it\u2019s subject to one very important limitation:\n\ntype ReadonlyFoo = { readonly bar: { baz: string } }; const x: ReadonlyFoo = {bar: {baz: 'quux'}}; x.bar.baz = 'zebranky'; // allowed\n\nWhat happened here? Well, we\u2019re not changing the bar property\u2014we\u2019re changing the baz property on the object assigned to the bar property; the object bar refers to is never replaced, so it\u2019s allowed. The same would happen if you assigned a mutable object to a const . You could never assign a new object, but mutating the object is very much permissible.\n\nIf you want to enforce immutability all the way down, you\u2019ll need more readonly modifiers:\n\ntype ReadonlyFoo = { readonly bar: { readonly baz: string } }; const x: ReadonlyFoo = {bar: {baz: 'quux'}}; x.bar.baz = 'zebranky'; // disallowed\n\nThe Readonly Mapped Type\n\nOf course, when you start adding lots of properties, typing readonly in front of each one can rapidly become tedious. TypeScript\u2019s Readonly mapped type can help:\n\ntype ReadonlyFoo = Readonly<{ bar: string, baz: string }>; const x: ReadonlyFoo = {bar: 'quux', baz: 'zebranky'}; x.bar = 'poit'; // disallowed x.baz = 'blat'; // disallowed\n\nReadonly only works on your top-level properties, though, so you\u2019ll need to reuse it when you go deeper:\n\ntype ReadonlyFoo = Readonly<{ bar: { baz: string } }>; const x: ReadonlyFoo = {bar: {baz: 'quux'}}; x.bar.baz = 'zebranky'; // allowed type DeeplyReadonlyFoo = Readonly<{ bar: Readonly }>; const y: DeeplyReadonlyFoo = {bar: {baz: 'quux'}}; y.bar.baz = 'zebranky'; // disallowed\n\nArrays and Dictionaries\n\nThis is great for manually constructed types that have known properties, but what about arrays? And dictionaries? There are solutions for both.\n\nArrays\n\nArrays have built-in support via the ReadonlyArray generic. (If you weren\u2019t already describing your array types as Array<T> instead of T[] , this is a great reason to start for consistency\u2019s sake\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 4 sentences.

  "\\section{Introduction}\r\nIn quantum theory, a wave function evolves continuously when left to itself. However, on observation, it undergoes an instantaneous `wave function collapse'. This constitutes the traditional Copenhagen interpretation\\cite{sep-qm-copenhagen}. And it is not explicitly specified how an observation and a unitary interaction differ from each other. Many have proposed different interpretations of quantum mechanics, some even without the idea of a wave function collapse. But as most of the interpretations share the same experimental outcomes, it is hard to prove any of them.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the mathematics that is followed by a quantum system has never been known to fail and has been applied to increasingly larger systems. Many phenomena widely different from our classical world have been seen. It is also not properly known where applicability of the quantum theory stops and the classical world begins to take over. As von Neumann writes, the mathematics of quantum theory allows a wave function collapse to be placed at any position in a causal chain of measurement devices up to the `subjective perception' of a human observer\\cite{von2018mathematical}. The point where we place the collapse of the wave function can be said to be the point where the classical world starts.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis article proposes a thought experiment addressing a part of von Neumann's statement. Specifically, the question of whether a quantum system that is in superposition could pass on its state of superposition to a measurement device (to form a causal chain).\r\n\r\n\\section{A Measurement Process}\r\nChoose a beam of circularly polarized light in the state-\r\n\r\n\\begin{equation}\r\n\t\\vert \\psi \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (\\vert R \\rangle + \\vert L \\rangle) \\label {eq:initial-state}\r\n\\end{equation}\r\n\r\n$\\vert R\\rangle $ and $\\vert L\\rangle $ indicate right and left circularly polarized light, respectively. When the beam of light passes through a Fresnel polyprism\\cite{arteaga2019stern}, it splits into right and left circularly polarized beams, respectively. This is an analogue of the Stern-Gerlach experiment with silver atoms. Two single-photon detectors\\cite{eisaman2011invited} at the two beams constitute a `measurement device'. See Ref \\cite{eisaman2011invited} for more on single-photon detectors. See Figure \\ref{fig:Measuring-the-state}.\r\n\r\n\\begin{figure}[h]\r\n\t\\centering\r\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.50\\linewidth]{Experiment_Figure_1}\r\n\t\\caption{A beam of light splits into right and left circularly polarized light, respectively and are detected at detectors $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$}\r\n\t\\label{fig:Measuring-the-state}\r\n\\end{figure}\r\n\r\nThe state of the whole system evolves into-\r\n\\begin{equation}\r\n\t\\vert \\psi\\rangle   =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\vert R\\rangle   \\vert D_{1}\\rangle   +\\vert L\\rangle   \\vert D_{2}\\rangle)   \\label{eq:first-entangled-state}\r\n\\end{equation}\r\n\r\n$\\vert D_{1}\\rangle $ and $\\vert D_{2}\\rangle $ indicate the detection of a photon at detectors $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$, respectively. Since detecting a photon at $D_{1}$ or $D_{2}$ shows, with certainty, the state of polarization of the photon, a wave function collapse occurs at the `measurement device'. As wave function collapse makes the system lose its quantum property of a superposed state, it forms the beginning of our everyday classical world.\r\n\r\nIf we, on the other hand, treat the `measurement device' as a quantum system as well, a second possibility of the `measurement device' being in superposition arises. A wave function collapse might not occur. Instead, the two detectors forming the `measurement device' might go into a state of superposition.\r\n\r\n\\section{Hong-Ou-Mandel Effect}\r\nTo probe this question, we shall make use of a two-photon quantum interference effect known as the `Hong-Ou-Mandel Effect' \\cite{branczyk2017hongoumandel}. The following section gives a simple account of how the effect works. \r\n\r\nConsider a non-linear crystal that splits a photon into two  of equal wavelength by a down conversion process\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 6 sentences.

While they still interact via the strong nuclear force, they are made up entirely of gluons rather than the quarks and antiquarks found in other hadrons like protons and neutrons. Glueballs are thought to arise due to the self-interactions of gluons within the quantum chromodynamic field, resulting in stable bound states that exhibit unique properties such as an absence of color charge and exotic mass distributions.\n\n* Q: How does our current understanding of glueballs relate to theories of confinement and the strong interaction? Can these insights shed light on other aspects of high energy physics?\n  * A: Understanding the nature of glueballs is closely linked to our knowledge of the strong interaction and its role in binding quarks into hadrons. Gluons are the mediators of the strong force, and their dynamics within glueballs provides a testbed for exploring ideas such as confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. Furthermore, the study of glueballs may also lead to important insights into other areas of high energy physics, including the search for new symmetries and the behavior of matter at extreme energies.\nAnswer:Step 1: Identify the main idea of each sentence:\n\nSentence 1: Ireland held a referendum on gay marriage in May 2015 and it was passed.\nSentence 2: There have been calls for similar legislation in other European countries, including Italy.\nSentence 3: Polls show a shift in public opinion towards gay marriage in Italy.\nSentence 4: However, there may be obstacles to passing such legislation in Italy due to conservative elements in society.\n\nStep 2: Create a topic sentence summarizing the information presented in these sentences:\n\n\"In May 2015, Ireland held a successful referendum on gay marriage, setting off a wave of interest in similar legislation across Europe, including Italy. Public opinion appears to favor gay marriage in Italy, but potential barriers exist, especially given societal conservatism.\"\nQuestion:One relevant and insightful question about the preceding context and previous questions could be: How does the memory or history of the interactions between the stars affect the spectral properties of an XRBT?\nAnswer:Certainly!

What impact does the observation of superpositions have on our understanding of wave functions in quantum theory? \n Observing superpositions allows us to directly witness continuous evolution of wave functions until a \"measurement\" or \"observation\" takes place, providing important insights into the foundations of quantum mechanics. Furthermore, these observations validate the unitarity and predictions of wave function collapse postulates which may lead researchers towards developing improved interpretations or mathematical models within this area of study.\nAnswer:Sure, I can provide an example response to one of the prompts:\n\nPrompt: How can advances in space exploration contribute to sustainability efforts on Earth?\n\nResponse:\nAdvances in space exploration have the potential to contribute significantly to sustainability\n\nQuestion:Q: \"What are the potential uses of space exploration in contributing to sustainability efforts on Earth?\"\nParaphrased A: \"Space exploration can contribute to sustainability efforts on Earth by advancing technology and providing new insights into environmental issues.\"\nAnswer the question step by step and explain your thoughts.

  "The FBI is facing claims it deliberately selected the emotionally charged case of the San Bernardino terrorist\u2019s iPhone to force a precedent on encryption policy.\n\n\u201cI think the FBI is being very selective here, and it has much more to do with the emotional value and public relations value of the case than it does with the FBI\u2019s real need for the phone,\u201d former White House counterterrorism and cybersecurity chief Richard Clarke told The Hill.\n\nLed by Director James Comey, the FBI has for months advocated different avenues for law enforcement to access locked communications with the appropriate court order. Technologists and privacy advocates have pushed back, insisting that impenetrable encryption is indispensable to online security and privacy.\n\nThe latest salvo in what's become an increasingly bitter fight came last week, when the agency asked federal judge Sheri Pym to issue a court order demanding Apple write a piece of software to disable certain security features on the county-owned work phone of San Bernardino, Calif., shooter Syed Rizwan Farook.\n\nFarook, with wife Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 in the December massacre.\n\nCritics are suggesting the FBI\u2019s choice was calculated. By pressing forward in a case with optics that seem cut and dry, they say, the agency could set a precedent that gives it the controversial guaranteed access Comey has been demanding.\n\n\"It\u2019s a brilliant tactic,\u201d said Chris Finan, a former Obama administration cybersecurity adviser who now heads California-based financial tech firm Manifold Technology. \u201cThey realize the public is going to be on their side.\u201d\n\nApple is opposing the order, arguing the FBI\u2019s demand sets \u201ca dangerous precedent\u201d that would eventually let the agency demand Apple build surveillance software to do everything from track a user\u2019s location to turn on his or her iPhone microphone without consent.\n\nComey has argued fiercely that the case impacts only Farook\u2019s phone, but such claims appeared tenuous when it was revealed Tuesday that the Justice Department is pursuing about a dozen undisclosed court orders to force Apple to help authorities access locked iPhones.\n\n\u201cGive me a break. Of course it has precedential value,\u201d Clarke said.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely it sets a precedent,\u201d Sen.

  "Ever since the Aam Aadmi party was formed, its national convener, Arvind Kejriwal, has spoken repeatedly about changing the politics of this country. While many have pooh-poohed this as the talk of just another newly minted politician, the AAP has shown that it is attempting something new and fundamentally different. The AAP has spoken extensvely about Swaraj and decentralization. They have highlighted the need for better governance. They strived for the Lokpal since their pre-political avatar. They dared to expose the powerful and connected. They have strived for transparency by publicizing all donations made to the party and refusing donations from people who wished to remain anonymous. Now, they have embarked on a civil disobedience movement of the kind not seen since independence.\n\nShortly after its formation, the AAP embarked on a series of exposes. The media took immediate notice because the exposes dared to take on the high and mighty across party lines. Interestingly, sections of the media privately praised the AAP party for its efforts, admitting that they had all this information all along but simply did not have the \u201cguts\u201d to lay it bare before the public \u2014 a classic example of the failure of our fourth estate. Unfortunately, despite the documentary evidence garnered from the public domain and from RTI filings, the government ignored the exposes. The media, meanwhile, was summarily threatened by large industrial houses from covering these exposes. The most recent of these exposes involved the Sheila Dikshit government of Delhi, and its hand in the inflated electricity and water bills of the residents of Delhi.\n\nSections of the media and several talking heads on TV have derided the AAP as a product of \u201cOB Van\u201d politics. They predicted boldly that they would vanish into insignificance once the OB Vans stopped covering them. The ongoing fast by Arvind Kejriwal has completely debunked this theory.

Fasting, on the other hand, is a highly visible form of protest that often evokes empathy and concern from others.

  "\\section{Introduction}\nTurbulent particle-laden flows are widely encountered in various environmental and engineering applications.\nA vast majority of the literature on particles-turbulence interactions in wall-bounded flows is dedicated to the study of neutrally buoyant particles, where the mean particle slip velocity vanishes throughout the domain except in the near-wall region.\nA finite density ratio in the presence of gravity results in settling of particles, and the sustained wake region near the particles substantially alters the nature of particle-turbulence interaction.\nIn the present work, we investigated the effect of dense finite-size particles in vertical channel flows of Newtonian and viscoelastic carrier fluids using direct numerical simulations. \n\n\nWhen the particle size is smaller or on the same order as the viscous dissipation length, turbulence modulation primarily depends on the Stokes number, defined as the ratio of particles to fluid response times \\citep[see][for regime classification based on the Stokes number]{elgobashi2006updated}.  \nA gravitational acceleration decouples the particles motion from the fluid, increases the Stokes number and, as a result, has an immediate impact on turbulence modulation. \nIt is known that small and heavy particles attenuate the turbulence intensity in homogeneous isotropic condition \\citep{gore1989effect,elghobashi1993two} as well as in turbulent channel flow \\citep{tsuji1984ldv}. \nIn the latter case the attenuation is particularly important in the cross-stream direction \\citep{kulick1994particle}.\nAt high particle concentrations, however, the strong inter-phase coupling triggers an alternative turbulence generation mechanism, where the turbulent kinetic energy is entirely generated by particles slip velocities \\citep{Capecelatro2018a}.\nParticles motion is also influenced by gravity:\nIn contrast to inertialess particles (or fluid elements) that are trapped inside eddies, dense particles escape the initially-surrounding eddies faster than the eddy decay rate\\textemdash a phenomenon known as ``crossing trajectories\" which decreases particles dispersion due to the subdued correlated motions \\citep{wells1983effects}.\n\n\nWhen the particle size lies in the inertial range of the turbulence, its wake interacts with turbulent eddies of different sizes \\citep{Cisse2013}, and the region of interaction extends to several particle diameters \\citep{Naso2010}.  \n\\citet{zeng2010wake} studied isolated stationary particles in turbulent channel flow and for a wide range of particle Reynolds numbers  ($\\Rey_p\\equiv d_p u_\\text{slip}/\\nu = [42-450]$, where $\\nu$, $d_p$ and $u_\\text{slip}$ denote fluid kinematic viscosity, particle diameter and slip velocity).\nThe authors highlighted the dual effect of particles, where the turbulence kinetic energy is \n(i) suppressed due to the damping of the streamwise fluctuations and \n(ii) augmented by vortex shedding and/or wake oscillations.\nTowards the lower range of particle Reynolds numbers ($\\Rey_p \\approx [26-33]$)), \\citet{vreman2018turbulent} considered a similar configuration and reported that particles create sinks of turbulence kinetic energy near their surfaces, although the turbulence suppression remains appreciable far from the particles. \nThey concluded that the primary reason for turbulence suppression is particle-induced non-uniformity of the mean driving force of the flow, rather than turbulence modulations in the vicinity of the particles.\t\nAt the higher particle Reynolds numbers ($\\Rey_p \\approx 400$), \\citet{kajishima2001turbulence} studied freely-moving finite-size particles and investigated the influence of vortex shedding on turbulence production in a vertical channel. \n\nAt $\\Rey_p \\approx 136$ and low volume fractions $\\varphi \\approx 0.5 \\%$, \\citet{uhlmann2008interface} reported enhanced wall-normal mixing with flattening of the mean velocity profiles.\nThey attributed the near-wall peak of particles concentrations to migration of particles in the direction opposite to gradients in the turbulence intensity\\textemdash a phenomenon known as``turbophoresis\" \\citep{Caporaloni1975}.   \nIn a follow-up study, \\citep{garcia2012dns} examined the same configuration with a twice longer streamwise length and they confirmed that particle and fluid statistics are not strongly affected by the streamwise extension of the domain, yet extremely long columnar flow structures remain correlated even at streamwise lengths on the order of $16h$, where $h$ is the channel half-width. Settling has also been examined in other canonical configurations including horizontal wall-bounded flows and homogeneous shear. In the former, \\citet{Shao2012a} concluded that at high density ratios particles form a sediment layer over the horizontal wall, which contributes to the turbulence intensity by vortex shedding, and \\citet{Kidanemariam2013b} observed an apparent lag in the mean particle velocity compared with that of the fluid due to particle accumulation in the low-speed regions.\nWhen gravity is directed perpendicular to the plane of homogeneous shear, \\citet{tanaka2017effect} concluded that the Reynolds shear stress is markedly decreased in the wake of particles and, in turn, the amplification of turbulent kinetic energy is reduced. \n\nAnother important implication of gravity and sustained particle wakes is the emergence of particle clusters. \nIn quiescent flow conditions and at sufficiently large $\\Rey_p$, the reduced drag acting upon trailing particles promotes cluster formation \\citep{wu1998dynamics,fortes1987nonlinear}. \nThis phenomenon has been extensively studied both experimentally \\citep{huisman2016columnar} and numerically \\citep{yin2007hindered}, and the onset of clustering is marked by a critical Galileo number which is defined as the ratio between gravitational and viscous forces \\citep{Uhlmann2014}.\nIn the presence of background turbulence, \\citep{chouippe2019influence} examined the clustering of finite-size particles in the presence of gravity, and highlighted that the background turbulence hinders cluster formation\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

Despite their positive effects on slowing the spread of the pandemaic, they neverthless caused severe impacts on the society, the economy and people's everyday life. There have been anti-lockdown and anti-social-distancing protests in many places around the world. Given these difficult situations, it is crucial for policy-makers  to understand people's opinions toward the pandemic so that they can (1) balance the concerns of stoping the pandemic on the one hand and keeping people in good spirits on the other hand and (2) anticipate people's reactions to certain events and policy so that the policy-makers can prepare in advance. More generally, a close look at the public affect during the time of COVID-19 could help us understand people's reaction and thoughts in the face of extreme crisis, which sheds light on humanity in moments of darkness.\n\nPeople constantly post about the pandemic on social media such as Twitter, Weibo  and Facebook. They express their\nattitudes and feelings regarding various aspects of the pandemic, such as the medical treatments, public policy, their worry, etc. Therefore, user-generated content on social media  provides  an important source for understanding \n public emotions and concerns.   \n\n In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis on the affective trajectories of American people and Chinese people based on Twitter and Weibo posts between January 20th, 2020 and May 11th 2020.\nWe identify fine-grained emotions (including anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise)  expressed\n on social media based on the user-generated content. \n  Additionally,\n  we build NLP taggers to \n   extract the triggers of different emotions, e.g., why people are angry or surprised, what they are worried, etc. \n    We also contrast public emotions  between China and the Unites States, \n revealing sharp differences in public reactions towards COVID-19 related issues in different countries. \n\nBy tracking the change of public sentiment and emotion  over time, \nour work sheds light on the evolution of public attitude towards this global crisis. \nThis work contributes to the growing body of research on social media content in the time of COVID-19.\nOur study provides a way to extracting public emotion towards the pandemic in real-time, and could potentially lead to better decision-making and the development of wiser interventions to fight this global crisis.  \n\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows:\nwe briefly go through some related work in Section 2. \nWe then present the analyses on topic trends in Weibo and Twitter (section 3), the extracted emotion trajectories (section 4) and triggers of those emotions (section 5). We finally conclude this paper in Section 6.\n\n\\section{Related Work}\n\\subsection{Analyses on Social Media Content about COVID-19  }\n\\begin{comment}\nThere has been a decade history of using NLP tools to analyze user-generated content on social media regarding variety of aspects, such as \nepidemic  detection \\cite{achrekar2011predicting,paul2011you,ji2012epidemic,li2013early},\nnatural disaster detection \\cite{sakaki2010earthquake,sakaki2012tweet}, \ntopic trend detection \\cite{hong2010empirical,o2010tweetmotif,zhao2011comparing},\nsentiment and emotion analysis \\cite{go2009twitter,o2010tweets,kouloumpis2011twitter,bollen2011modeling,balabantaray2012multi,severyn2015twitter,kumar2015emotion},\nentity and event extraction \\cite{ritter2011named,ritter2012open,li2014major,zhou2014simple,deng2015overview}. \n\\end{comment}\n\nAt the time of writing, analyses on people's discussions and behaviors on social media  in the context of COVID-19 has attracted increasing attention. \n\\cite{alshaabi2020world} \nanalyzed tweets concerning  \nCOVID-19 on\nTwitter by\nselecting important 1-grams based on rank-turbulence divergence\nand compare languages used in early 2020 with the ones used a year ago. \nThe authors observed the first peak of public attention to COVID-19 around January 2020 with the first wave of infections in China, and the \nsecond peak later when the outbreak hit many western countries. \n\\cite{chen2020covid} released the first COVID-19 Twitter dataset. \n\\cite{kleinberg2020measuring}\nprovided a ground truth corpus by annotating 5,000\ntexts (2,500 short + 2,500 long texts) in UK and\nshowed\n people's worries about their families and economic situations. \n\\cite{gao2020mental} viewed emotions and sentiments on social media as indicators of mental\nhealth issues, which result from self-quarantining and social isolation\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 4 sentences.

Title: The title should be short, concise, and capture the essence of the paper. It should also be informative and easy to understand.\n2. Abstract: The abstract should be a standalone summary of the paper that can be understood by someone who has not read the rest of the paper. It should include the main purpose of the paper, the key findings, and why they are important.\n3. Introduction: The introduction should set the scene by providing some background information and context for the paper. It should explain the motivation for the study, the research question, and the novelty of the work.\n4. Methods: The methods section should describe the experimental design, the materials and equipment used, and the procedures followed. It should be detailed enough that another scientist could replicate your experiment.\n5. Results: The results section should present the raw data and the key findings of the study in a clear and objective manner. Tables and figures should be used to illustrate the data.\n6. Discussion: The discussion section should interpret the results in light of the wider scientific context. It should discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the study, any unexpected findings, and the implications of the work.\n7. Conclusions: The conclusions section should summarize the main findings of the paper and the major takeaways. It should reiterate the original research question and whether it was answered.\nAnswer:Yes, that sounds good! Here are some additional steps you can take to edit this sentence for clarity and conciseness:\n\n1. Remove unnecessary words like \"really\" or \"actually\" as they don't add value to the statement. In this case, I removed \"actual.\"\n2. Check for grammar errors such as subject-verb agreement or parallel structure mistakes. Here, we have one singular noun (\"information\") followed by plural verbs (\"can be\" and \"has\"). This makes the second part of the sentence sound awkward. To fix it, let's rewrite the sentence using more consistent verb forms. Let's change \"can be\" to \"is\" (singular) and keep \"have been\" (plural). This way, both parts of the sentence will follow similar structures.\n3. Break up long sentences into shorter ones with clear topics and points. By breaking down complex information into smaller chunks, readers will find it easier to understand the content. For example, in the previous paragraph, let's divide the information into two shorter sentences, each focused on a specific point.\n4. Choose active voice over passive voice when possible. Active voice allows the reader to clearly identify who performed the action in the sentence.

  "Sure! Here's a summary of the preceding context in 4 sentences:\nResearchers have found that emotions and sentiments expressed on social media can be indicators of mental health issues, such as self-quarantining and social isolation. The study by Gao et al. (2020) suggests that these emotions and sentiments can be used to detect early warning signs of mental health issues in individuals. The study also found that social media can be a useful tool for monitoring and addressing mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. By analyzing social media data, researchers and healthcare professionals can gain insights into the mental health of individuals and provide timely support and interventions.\nPrevious Question \nQuestion:As an AI assistant I do not have personal feelings or opinions but here are a few tips to make sure your responses are clear and concise\n\n1. Make sure your response answers the user\u2019s question and does not veer off topic.\n2. Avoid being too brief. Make sure your answer provides enough detail without being too long winded.\n3. Try to anticipate what type of follow up questions the user might ask and try to include those answers in your response if possible.\nAnswer:Instead, provide clear explanations for each point you make. Use complete sentences and proper grammar.\nQuestion:Here's my take on summarizing the discussion so far:\nIt seems like we're exploring ways in which our mental wellbeing is affected by external factors, specifically how online activity on social media can signal certain psychological states such as self-isolation and anxiety due to COVID-19. We also discussed strategies to improve our writing clarity when providing AI assistance through effective communication techniques. Is there anything else we need to cover before moving forward?\nAnswer:Step 1: Understand the prompt\nThe prompt is asking for information about the emotions and reactions from the crowd and players during Hank Aaron's historic home run in 1974 to tie Babe Ruth's all-time record of 714 home runs.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the available information\nFrom the given information, we know that Hank Aaron hit a historic home run in 1974 against the Los Angeles Dodgers that tied Babe Ruth's all-time record of 714 home runs. We also know that the pitcher was Al Downing and that the ball was caught by Dodgers outfielder Bill Buckner, who couldn't hold onto it, and it bounced off the wall. However, there is no specific information provided on the emotions and reactions from the crowd and players during this momentous event.\n\nStep 3: Synthesize information and form an answer\nBased on the limited information provided, it can be inferred that the emotions and reactions from the crowd and players during Hank Aaron's historic home run would have been a mix of excitement, pride, and admiration. This is because Aaron's achievement was significant not only for himself but also for baseball history as he broke one of the most prestigious records in the sport.

  "\\section{Introduction}\r\n\\label{intro}\r\nThe holographic principle was put forward in 1993 \\cite{'tHooft:1993gx,Susskind:1994vu} and asserts that all of the information contained in some region of space can be represented as a hologram, a theory located on the boundary of that region. This theory should contain at most one degree of freedom per Planck area. Since then,\r\n the holographic principle has been fruitfully developed, as in its most well known implementation, the AdS/CFT correspondence \\cite{Maldacena:1997re}, as well as in its connection with M-theory \\cite{Horava:1997dd}. A\r\ncosmological version of the holographic principle was proposed\r\nin \\cite{Fischler:1998st}.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall study in this paper how the holographic principle applies to an accelerating universe filled with a tachyon scalar field with a constant equation of state (EoS) $w=p/\\rho$, for both the spacetimes  of the region $-1<w<-1/3$ and the phantom domain $w<-1$. In order to do so, we shall make use of a covariant procedure \\cite{Bousso:2002ju} and the results will be confronted with those given by the holographic dark energy model with the future event horizon as the infrared cutoff \\cite{Li:2004rb}. Our analysis is relevant in at least two aspects . On the one hand, dark energy should contain a large amount of the relevant degrees of freedom and hence, in order to constrain the EoS for dark energy, it is important to investigate whether such degrees of freedom are projected on the same boundary surfaces as those characterising the remaining non-vacuum energy. On the other hand, a universe with constant EoS $w$ that accelerates indefinitely will exhibit a future event horizon \\cite{He:2001za} (see, however, \\cite{GonzalezDiaz:2001ce}), presenting a challenge for string theories because it is not possible to construct a conventional S-matrix as the local observer inside his horizon is not able to isolate particles to be scattered. The emergence of an event horizon at the future, which would behave as a holographic screen, would aggravate this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis paper can be outlined as follows. Sec.\\ \\ref{sec:tachyonDE} contains the spacetime of a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Wal-ker (FRW) universe filled\r\nwith a tachyon scalar field in the region $w>-1$. In Sec.\\ \\ref{sec:covtachyonDE} a covariant formalism is used to\r\nderive the holographic preferred screens that correspond to\r\nthe spacetime presented in Sec.\\ \\ref{sec:tachyonDE}. In Sec.\\ \\ref{sec:phtachyonDE} we discuss\r\nthe covariant holography of a flat tachyonic phantom energy scenario. In Sec.\\ \\ref{sec:HDE},\r\nthe dark and phantom holographic dark energy models are constructed for a flat geometry in order to insert\r\nholographic screens in terms of the future event\r\nhorizon \\cite{Li:2004rb} or the horizon at the big rip \\cite{GonzalezDiaz:2005sh}. The conclusions are drawn in Sec.\\ \\ref{sec:concl}.\r\n\r\n\\section{The spacetime of a universe filled with tachyonic dark energy}\\label{sec:tachyonDE}\r\n\r\nThe explanation of dark energy is a central preoccupation of present-day cosmology.\r\nIn the $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm, in which the cosmological constant accounts for the acceleration of the universe, the\r\nuniverse would asymptotically tend to the de Sitter space-time whose\r\nholographic properties have already been studied in some depth \\cite{Karch:2003em,Alishahiha:2005dj}.\r\nHowever, the dark energy could perfectly be dynamical in nature, even favored over the cosmological constant \\cite{Samushia:2012iq}\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 4 sentences.

They enjoy a diverse\r\nrange of applications, primarily in the quantum information community\r\n\\cite{caruso2014}, but also in studies of matrix product states \\cite{Fannes1992,Perez-Garcia2006},\r\nentanglement renormalization \\cite{Giovannetti2008,Pfeifer2009},\r\ncomputability theory \\cite{aaronson2016}, and even biological inference\r\nprocesses \\cite{Lee2016}. The canonical form of a quantum channel\r\n$\\A$ and its adjoint $\\A^{\\dgt}$ (a generalization of the Heisenberg\r\npicture defined under the Frobenius norm) is \\cite{Sudarshan1961,Kraus1971,Choi1975}\r\n\\begin{equation}\r\n\\A\\left(\\r\\right)=\\sum_{\\ell}A^{\\ell}\\r A^{\\ell\\dg}\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\text{and}\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\A^{\\dgt}\\left(O\\right)=\\sum_{\\ell}A^{\\ell\\dg}OA^{\\ell}\\,,\\label{eq:kraus}\r\n\\end{equation}\r\nwhere $\\A$ acts on states $\\r$ and $\\A^{\\dgt}$ on operators $O$.\r\nThe matrices $A^{\\ell}$ are called the Kraus operators of $\\A\\equiv\\left\\{ A^{\\ell}\\right\\} $,\r\neq. (\\ref{eq:kraus}) is the Kraus form of $\\A$, and the only requirement\r\nfor the channel to be trace preserving is (for $I$ identity) \r\n\\begin{equation}\r\n\\sum_{\\ell}A^{\\ell\\dg}A^{\\ell}=I\\,.\\label{eq:cptp}\r\n\\end{equation}\r\nQuantum channels can be represented as matrices acting on a vectorized\r\ndensity matrix, i.e., the $D\\times D$ matrix $\\r$ written as a $D^{2}$-dimensional\r\nvector. Vectorization essentially ``flips'' the bra part in each\r\nof the outer products making up $\\r$ and $\\A$ is written as a $D^{2}\\times D^{2}$\r\nmatrix of the form $\\hat{\\A}=\\sum_{\\ell}A^{\\ell}\\ot A^{\\ell\\star}$\r\nacting on the vectorized $\\r$ strictly from the left. This \\textit{matrix\r\nor Liouville representation} of $\\A$ \\cite{Caves1999} is equivalent\r\nto the Kraus representation (\\ref{eq:kraus}), and I slightly abuse\r\nnotation by ignoring hats and not distinguishing the two. \r\n\r\nIn the matrix representation, channels can be studied in terms of\r\ntheir eigenvalues and eigenmatrices. The eigenvalues of all channels\r\nare contained in the unit disk, and this work focuses on the eigenvalues/matrices\r\n$\\st$ on the periphery of that disk, i.e.,\r\n\\begin{equation}\r\n\\A\\left(\\st\\right)=e^{i\\la}\\st\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\text{for some real }\\la\\,.\r\n\\end{equation}\r\nSuch eigenmatrices are called the channel's (right) \\textit{rotating\r\npoints}, and those with $\\la=0$ are called \\textit{fixed points}.\r\nThe $\\St$'s do not have to be physical states themselves, but they\r\nare a matrix basis for such states. Since $\\A$ may not be diagonalizable,\r\nthe eigenmatrices $J$ of its adjoint \\textemdash{} left rotating\r\npoints \\textemdash{} may be different from $\\St$:\r\n\\begin{equation}\r\n\\A^{\\dgt}\\left(J\\right)=e^{-i\\la}J\\,.\r\n\\end{equation}\r\nLeft rotating points will be called \\textit{conserved quantities}\r\nbecause their expectation value is either constant or oscillates with\r\nsuccessive powers of $\\A$, but does not decay:\r\n\\begin{equation}\r\n\\tr\\{J\\A^{n}(\\r)\\}=\\tr\\{\\A^{\\dgt n}(J)\\r\\}=e^{-in\\la}\\tr\\{J\\r\\}\\,.\r\n\\end{equation}\r\nThe general block structure of $\\varPsi$'s is already well-known\r\n\\cite{robin,Lindblad1999,BlumeKohout2008,baumr,Carbone2015}, and\r\nhere the focus is on the structure of the $J$'s. It is important\r\nto note that there are as many conserved quantities as there are rotating\r\npoints (more technically, the Jordan normal form of $\\A$ contains\r\nonly trivial Jordan blocks for all eigenvalues on the periphery of\r\nthe unit disk; see, e.g., Prop 6.2 in Ref. \\cite{wolf2010})\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 7 sentences.

Recall that a function $f:\\ K\\to \\overline{K}_c$ (where\n$\\overline{K}_c$ is a completion of an algebraic closure of $K$) is called $\\mathbf F_q$-linear\nif $f(t_1+t_2)=f(t_1)+f(t_2)$ and $f(\\alpha t)=\\alpha f(t)$ for any\n$t,t_1,t_2\\in K$, $\\alpha \\in \\mathbf F_q$. In a similar way one can define a\nnotion of a  $\\mathbf F_q$-linear function on any $\\mathbf F_q$-subspace of $K$,\nand also a notion of a $\\mathbf F_q$-linear operator on a vector space\nover $K$.\n\nTools of classical calculus are not sufficient to study behavior\nof $\\mathbf F_q$-linear functions. For example, if such a function $f$ is\ndifferentiable then $f'(t)\\equiv \\mbox{const}$, and all the\nhigher derivatives vanish irrespective of possible properties of\n$f$. In particular, one cannot reconstruct the Taylor\ncoefficients of a holomorphic function -- the classical formula\ncontains the expression $\\frac{f^{(n)}(t)}{n!}$ where both the\nnumerator and denominator vanish.\n\nThanks to Carlitz, we know the correct analogue of the factorial.\nA counterpart of a higher derivative is given in this paper. In\nfact, its main ingredient, the difference operator $\\Delta\n^{(n)}$,\n$$\n\\left( \\Delta ^{(n)}f\\right) (t)=\\Delta ^{(n-1)}f(xt)-\nx^{q^{n-1}}\\Delta ^{(n-1)}f(t),\\quad n\\ge 1;\\ \\ \\Delta ^{(0)}=\n\\mbox{id},\n$$\nwhere $x$ is a prime element in $K$, was introduced by Carlitz\nand often used subsequently.\n\nOur approach is based on identities for the difference operator\n$\\Delta =\\Delta ^{(1)}$, which emerge as a function field\nanalogue of the Bargmann-Fock representation of the canonical\ncommutation relations of quantum mechanics [9, 14]. Note that an\nanalogue of the Schr\\\"odinger representation was obtained in\n[12].\n\nWe will also use $\\Delta ^{(n)}$ in order to characterize\n``smoothness'' of $\\mathbf F_q$-linear functions and obtain an exact\ncorrespondence between the degree of smoothness (or analyticity)\nand the decay rate for coefficients of Fourier-Carlitz\nexpansions. Note that in the $p$-adic case (where smoothness is\nunderstood in a conventional sense) such a correspondence was\nfound in [1, 2, 15].\n\nHaving a new ``derivative'', we can introduce a kind of an\nantiderivative, and a Volkenborn type integral (see [15, 19] for the\ncase of zero characteristic), which leads, in particular, to an\nintegral representation of the Carlitz logarithm, establishing a direct\nconnection between the latter and the Carlitz module operation.\n\n\\section{PRELIMINARIES}\n\\subsection{{\\it Carlitz Basis} {\\rm [3, 4, 6, 12, 20]}}\n\nDenote by $|\\cdot |$ the non-Archimedean absolute value on $K$; if\n$z\\in K$,\n$$\nz=\\sum _{i=n}^\\infty \\zeta_ix^i,\\quad n\\in \\mathbf Z,\\ \\zeta_i\\in \\mathbf F_q \\ ,\n\\ \\zeta_n\\ne 0,\n$$\nthen $|z|=q^{-n}$\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 8 sentences.

  "\\section{Introduction}\n\n\\noindent\nIn recent years, a lot of progress has been made in understanding the\nRiemannian aspects of noncommutative geometry. The Levi-Civita\nconnection of a metric plays a crucial role in classical Riemannian\ngeometry and it is important to understand to what extent a\ncorresponding noncommutative theory exists. Several impressive results\nexist, which computes the curvature of the noncommutative torus from\nthe heat kernel expansion and consider analogues of the classical\nGauss-Bonnet theorem\n\\cite{ct:gaussBonnet,fk:gaussBonnet,fk:scalarCurvature,cm:modularCurvature}.\nHowever, starting from a spectral triple, with the metric implicitly\ngiven via the Dirac operator, it is far from obvious if there exists a\nmodule together with a bilinear form, representing the metric\ncorresponding to the Dirac operator, not to mention the existence of a\nLevi-Civita connection. In order to better understand what kind of\nresults one can expect, it is interesting to take a more naive\napproach, where one starts with a module together with a metric, and\ntries to understand under what conditions one may discuss metric\ncompatibility, as well as torsion and uniqueness, of a general connection.\n\nIn \\cite{aw:cgb.sphere,aw:curvature.three.sphere}, psuedo-Riemannian\ncalculi were introduced as a framework to discuss the existence of\na metric and torsion free connection as well as properties of its\ncurvature. In fact, the theory is somewhat similar to that of\nLie-Rinehart algebras, where a real calculus (as introduced in\n\\cite{aw:curvature.three.sphere}) might be considered as a\n``noncommutative Lie-Rinehart algebra''. Lie-Rinehart algebras have\nbeen discussed from many points of view (see\ne.g. \\cite{r:differential.forms,h:poisson.cohomology} and\n\\cite{aa:kpalgebras} for an overview of metric aspects).  Although the\nexistence of a Levi-Civita connection is not always guaranteed in\nthe context of pseudo-Rimannian calculi, it was shown that the\nconnection is unique if it exists. The theory has concrete\nsimilarities with classical differential geometry, and several ideas,\nsuch as Koszul's formula, have direct analogues in the noncommutative\nsetting. Apart from the noncommutative torus, noncommutative spheres\nwere considered, and a Chern-Gauss-Bonnet type theorem was proven for\nthe noncommutative 4-sphere \\cite{aw:cgb.sphere}\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 6 sentences.

  "Sure! Here's a summary of the context in seven sentences:\n\nResearchers have studied the Hawking radiation of quantum gravity near a black hole event horizon using semi-classical general relativity. The black hole radiates into particles with energies around the mass of the particle-antiparticle pair, but some energy goes into radiation. Recently discovered that these events occur much faster than expected and appear to indicate an object with negative mass-energy density near a Schwartzchild Event Horizon (Schwartzchild BH EH), meaning there is less negative vacuum degeneracy outside event horizons. Black holes may emit particles individually and often, possibly spanning extreme distances between these rare particles with unmatched precision before they decay back into other Hawkings radiations if still extant or another kind altogether because of dark force. Researchers investigated further regarding Hawking radiations around the vicinity, near extremal conditions (Kretskii et al., Ref.), specifically about rapid changes close enough so their rotation frequencies don't get diluted past certain thresholds; surprising discoveries suggest nearly perfect matchups where two particles disappear due solely through entanglement rather naturally leading up instead just relies heavily through entanglement alone thanks largely due entropic constraints put place during formation phase preventing sudden changes within certain bounds while keeping track underlying principles governing all related phenomena within our observable reach today without major inconsistencies found among all results obtained hitherto\nPrevious Question \nQuestion:The key takeaways from the text are that:\n1. Physics seeks to understand the fundamental principles that govern all natural phenomena, without significant inconsistencies in the existing body of knowledge.\n2. The scientific method is a systematic process for developing and testing theories based on empirical evidence, mathematical models, and logical reasoning.\n3. The Standard Model of particle physics provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the fundamental particles and forces in the universe.\nAnswer:Sure! Here's my answer broken down into steps:\n\nStep 1: Begin by acknowledging the question and asking for clarification if needed. You could say something like, \"Thank you for your question. Can you please clarify which specific implementation of bigger blocks you are referring to?\"\n\nStep 2: Explain the basics of the potential implementation of bigger blocks in Bitcoin, including why it's being considered and what the main arguments for and against it are. You could say something like, \"Bitcoin is considering implementing bigger blocks as a solution to the scaling issues it currently faces. Supporters argue that larger blocks are necessary to increase transaction speed and lower costs, while opponents worry about the security risks and potential for centralization.\"\n\nStep 3: Outline the various scenarios that could play out depending on whether or not the proposed implementation goes through. Some possibilities include a fork in the blockchain, a loss of confidence in Bitcoin's ability to scale efficiently, and potential attacks on the network. You could say something like, \"If the proposed implementation goes through, we could see a number of different outcomes. These include a fork in the blockchain, a loss of confidence in Bitcoin's ability to scale efficiently, and potential attacks on the network. On the other hand, if the proposal is rejected, we could continue to see slow transaction times and high fees as the status quo continues.\"\n\nStep 4: Analyze the impact each scenario could have on the future of blockchain technology. Consider factors such as adoption rates, investment interest, and overall perception of the technology. You could say something like, \"Depending on which outcome occurs\nQuestion:For example, you might ask something like, \"What factors do you think will drive the adoption rate for this new technology?\"\nAnswer:Certainly! Here's my revised reaction:\n\n What are the potential implications of the proposed implementation of bigger blocks in Bitcoin on its long-term success and adoption?\n\n The implementation of bigger blocks in Bitcoin has the potential to significantly improve its scalability and reduce transaction costs, which could lead to increased adoption and usage of the cryptocurrency. However, there are also concerns about the security risks and potential for centralization associated with larger blocks. If implemented correctly, the changes could position Bitcoin as a leader in the cryptocurrency market and attract\nQuestion:Great job breaking down complex information into smaller chunks. It sounds like you did well answering this question, especially when considering the potential impact on adoption rates and investment interest.

To improve readability, consider simplifying your language and organizing your thoughts more concisely. For instance, try starting your paragraphs with clear subject statements followed by a few concise supporting points, and end with concluding statements summarizing your insights.\nAnswer:Q: What is the purpose of the Standard Model in particle physics and how does it provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the fundamental particles and forces in the universe?\nA: The Standard Model is a theoretical framework in particle physics that aims to explain the fundamental particles and forces in the universe. It combines empirical evidence, mathematical models, and logical reasoning to create a systematic process for developing and testing theories. This model includes all known elementary particles and forces, except for gravity, and provides a coherent understanding of the underlying structure of matter and the fundamental forces that govern it.\nThe Standard Model is successful in explaining a wide range of phenomena, from the behavior of subatomic particles in accelerators to the properties of atoms and the structure of the universe itself. It has been tested and confirmed by numerous experimental findings, further solidifying its status as a comprehensive framework for understanding the universe at its most fundamental level.\n\nAsk a single relevant and insightful question about the preceding context and previous questions.

As mentioned earlier, it implies that black holes radiate away particles with energies similar to their mass. Therefore, the presence of Hawking radiation around the event horizon makes it difficult to study the innermost regions of black holes directly. Instead, researchers must study the behavior of Hawking radiation and its interactions with other objects in order to gain insights into the characteristics of black holes. In addition, Hawking radiation plays a crucial role in the evolution of black holes over time, as it can lead to gradual evaporation or accretion onto neighboring celestial bodies. Understanding the effects of Hawking radiation on the dynamics of black holes is essential for building a complete picture of the behavior of these enigmatic cosmic entities.\nAnswer the question step by step and explain your thoughts.

  "\\section{Introduction}\n\nThe ${\\cal{PT}}$-symmetric classical Hamiltonian of coupled harmonic oscillators with\nbalanced loss and gain admits periodic solution\nin the unbroken ${\\cal{PT}}$ phase of the system\\cite{ben}. The bounded\nsolution becomes unbounded as a result of phase-transition from an unbroken\nto a broken ${\\cal{PT}}$ phase. The change in the nature of solutions\naccompanied by the ${\\cal{PT}}$ phase-transition has important physical\nconsequences\\cite{bpeng}. Further, the corresponding quantum system is well\ndefined in appropriate Stokes wedges and admits bound states in the same\nunbroken ${\\cal{PT}}$ phase\\cite{ben}. This has lead to introduction of many\n${\\cal{PT}}$-symmetric Hamiltonian systems with balanced loss and gain\n\\cite{ben1,ivb, ds-pkg,khare, pkg-ds, ds-pkg1,p6-deb,pkg-1}. The examples\ninclude many-particle systems\\cite{ben1, pkg-ds, ds-pkg1,p6-deb}, systems with\nnonlinear interaction\\cite{ivb,ds-pkg, khare,pkg-ds, ds-pkg1,p6-deb},\nsystems with space-dependent loss-gain terms\\cite{ds-pkg1}, systems with\nLorentz interaction\\cite{pkg-1} etc.. The important\nresults which are common to all these models is that ${\\cal{PT}}$-symmetric\nHamiltonian systems with balanced loss and gain may admit bounded and periodic\nsolutions in some regions of the space of parameters. The bounded and\nunbounded solutions exist in the unbroken and broken ${\\cal{PT}}$-phases of\nthe system, respectively. The corresponding quantum system admits bound\nstates in well defined Stokes wedges. A few ${\\cal{PT}}$ symmetric, but\nnon-Hamiltonian classical systems with balanced loss and gain are also known\nto share the above properties\\cite{khare-0,kono}. \n\nThe investigations on classical Hamiltonian systems with balanced loss and gain are \nmostly restricted to ${\\cal{PT}}$ symmetric models. One plausible reason is that\n${\\cal{PT}}$-symmetric non-hermitian quantum systems admit entirely real spectra and unitary\ntime-evolution in unbroken ${\\cal{PT}}$-phase\\cite{ben-2}. The same result is valid for\na non-${\\cal{PT}}$-symmetric Hamiltonian provided it is pseudo-hermitian with respect\nto a positive-definite similarity operator\\cite{ali} and/or admits an antilinear\nsymmetry. A few examples of non-${\\cal{PT}}$ symmetric non-hermitian Hamiltonian admitting\nentirely real spectra and unitary time evolution may be found in the Refs.\\cite{ali,pkg-ph,af,\npkg-o-1,pkg-susy,pkg-many,pt-qm-0,pt-qm-1}.\nIt is known\\cite{pkg-ds,ds-pkg1} that  systems involving a non-conventional ${\\cal{T}}$-symmetry\nalso share the same properties. In classical mechanics, there is no notion of pseudo-hermiticity or\nanti-linear symmetry and the time-reversal symmetry is unique.\nConsequently, the criterion for a classical system with balanced loss and gain to\nadmit periodic solution is solely based on ${\\cal{PT}}$-symmetry.\n\nThere are no compelling reasons to accept that only ${\\cal{PT}}$-symmetric classical\nHamiltonian system with balanced loss and gain may admit periodic solutions\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

These include:\n\n1. Uncovering novel electronic phenomena: As we move away from simple geometries like 1D chains or square lattices, we may discover entirely new types of electronic behavior that arise due to the complexity of the underlying geometry. For instance, we might find that certain combinations of structural features can give rise to emergent topological phases or unconventional superconductivity.\n2. Revealing hidden symmetries: Many complex geometries possess subtle symmetries that are not immediately apparent. By investigating these structures, we may identify previously unknown relationships between geometry and electronic properties, potentially leading to new ways of controlling material properties through tuning the underlying symmetry.\n3. Enabling new applications: Exploring more complex geometries could also pave the way for the development of novel materials with tailored electronic properties. For example, understanding how to manipulate the geometric structure of nanoparticles could enable the creation of ultra-sensitive sensors or highly efficient catalysts.\n4. Improving our theoretical models: Studying complex geometries will provide valuable data to test and refine existing theories of electron transport in condensed matter systems. This can help us better understand the limits of current models and guide future research directions.\n5. Building towards quantum computers: Finally, probing more complex geometries could be crucial for realizing practical quantum computing devices. Many promising architectures rely on engineered electronic states in low-dimensional materials, and understanding how to create and control these states in more complex environments could bring us closer to harnessing the power of quantum mechanics for computation.\n\nQuestion:In terms of applications, where else does this sort of Boltzmann equation work well?\nBoltzmann equations have a wide range of applications in many-body physics, atomic and molecular collisions, condensed matter physics, biology and fluid mechanics. They play an important role in studying transport properties of materials, chemical reactions and energy transfer mechanisms.\nEnergy-dependent models can also be developed using Boltzmann equation techniques.

  "\\section{Introduction}\\label{introduction}\r\nInspired by biological molecular motors, in recent years there has been an upsurge of \r\nresearch efforts to construct artificial devices, which deliver mechanical work or propel \r\nthemselves in a liquid environment. It has been demonstrated experimentally that a \r\nmicron-sized Janus particle, half-coated with metal and suspended in a near critical binary \r\nsolvent, self-propels after illumination with light of low intensity \r\n\\cite{Volpe-et:2011,Buttinioni-et:2012}. Ever since, this type of light activated \r\nself-propellers has been intensively used for studying active matter. The phenomena, which \r\nhave been explored this way, range from clustering and phase separation in dense suspensions~\\cite{Buttinioni-et:2013}, over\r\nthe circular motion ~\\cite{Kuemmel-et:2013} and gravitaxis~\\cite{Hagen-et:2014} of asymmetric \r\nself-propelled objects, to phototactic behavior~\\cite{Lozano-et:2016,Gomez-Solano-et:2017} \r\nand self-propulsion in viscoelastic fluids~\\cite{Gomez-Solano-et:2016,Lozano-et:2018,Narinder-et:2018,Narinder-et:2019} \r\nand dense colloidal suspensions~\\cite{Lozano-et:2019}. \r\n\r\nAnother important direction of research aims at understanding the self-propulsion \r\nmechanism in these systems, which is rather complex. The source of the active motion \r\nis provided by the local demixing of a binary solvent, which is observed \r\naround the Janus colloid after its illumination by light of sufficient intensity, \r\nsuch that the metal cap is heated above the lower critical temperature $T_c$ of the solvent. \r\nEvidence has been gathered that the onset of the motion as well as its direction and its speed \r\ndepend sensitively on system parameters, such as the wetting properties of both \r\nhemispheres of the Janus particle, the intensity of the illumination, the particle size, \r\nor the average composition of the solvent. \r\n\r\nHydrodynamic models shed light on the processes occurring at steady state, i.e., \r\nafter a local demixing has been completed and a droplet, rich in the \r\nspecies preferred by the hot hemisphere of the Janus particle, has been formed \r\n\\cite{Gomez-Solano-et:2017,Wuerger2015,samin2016,Araki:2019}. \r\nHowever, the relevance of the diffusive dynamics, which dominates the \r\ncoarsening process at early and transient times, is still unclear. So far, the early stage \r\ndiffusive dynamics of a local demixing near a Janus particle has been studied only for \r\ntemperature quenches, which do not cross the binodal of demixing~\\cite{Roy-et:2018}. \r\nDeeper quenches have been studied only for homogeneously heated particles~\\cite{Roy-et:2018a}.\r\n\r\nThis has motivated us to combine experiment and theory in order to investigate the\r\nnon-equilibrium coarsening dynamics around a hot spherical Janus particle suspended in a \r\nbinary solvent. This is a challenging task because of technical limitations of both approaches. \r\nConcerning the experiments, one has to use large particles in order to be able to \r\nresolve the coarsening patterns. On the other hand, simulations for \r\nlarge particles are restricted by the availability of computing power. \r\nAccordingly, a quantitatively reliable comparison of the corresponding \r\nresults is not always possible. We used an optical microscope to measure the time evolution of \r\nthe surface layers and the subsequent growth of a droplet near the heated golden hemisphere. \r\nAfter implementing a suitable confinement, a single colloidal particle can be immobilized, which allows one \r\nto perform accurate measurements of the composition profiles around the particle as a function \r\nof time. In order to be able to judge the relevance of hydrodynamic effects \r\nin the transient dynamics, we compare the experimental data with the results \r\nobtained from two models, i.e., purely diffusive model B and model H which includes hydrodynamics.   \r\n\r\nWe find that the coarsening dynamics around immobilized Janus particles \r\nis more involved than the one observed for a self-propelling particle: the coarsening patterns \r\nwhich form around a fixed particle at later times are not observed around a mobile particle. \r\nSuch patterns might, however, be relevant for Janus particles in optical potentials, \r\nwhich have been recently studied in the context of, e\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 5 sentences.

  "Based on the provided text, the key takeaways are:\n1. Chiral particles, such as chiral-coated colloids, display a left-right bias in motion because of their specific shape and the resulting flow field around them. The asymmetric flow generates a shear stress, which responds differently to the presence of the particle's coat or core, thus affecting its behavior.\n2. The observed behavior is a consequence of the interplay between elastic and inertial forces that result from the asymmetric hydrodynamic interactions of a chiral particle in a fluid.\n3. In a chiral colloid, the behavior of the coat is typically more affected by the local shear rate due to the elastic stress response, while the core is more affected by the inertial forces. This asymmetry can lead to the observed net flow of the particle.\n4. The study of asymmetric hydrodynamic interactions is important for understanding the motion of chiral particles, which could have applications in various fields such as self-assembly, microfluidics, and biomedical diagnosis.\nPrevious Question \nQuestion:Sure!

  "\\section{Introduction}\nTriangular clusters form one of the most basic building blocks of frustrated magnets in two dimensions~\\cite{Starykh2015}, including the paradigmatic Heisenberg antiferromagnets on the triangular or kagome lattice. In particular the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the kagome lattice, which can be interpreted as a a lattice of corner-sharing triangles, has attracted considerable interest as a promising system for realizing a quantum spin liquid~\\cite{Savary2016,Yan2011,Depenbrock2012,Jiang2012,He2017} in its groundstate. In most candidate materials, the magnetic exchange couplings do however not realize a perfect kagome lattice and are instead distorted~\\cite{Norman2016}, which can have significant impact on the low temperature physics, e.g., by stabilizing magnetic order~\\cite{Schnyder2008}, precluding the formation of a quantum spin liquid.\n\nThis is, however, not true for all kinds of distortions, as seen for example in the \u201cbreathing-distorted\u201d kagome lattice, where upward and downward triangles both remain equilateral but inequivalent to each other (\\cref{fig:lattices}(a))~\\cite{Mila98,Aidoudi2011,Honecker11}. Even under strong such breathing distortion, a quantum spin-liquid phase of the kagome lattice is expected to be stable~\\cite{Repellin2017,Jahromi2020}. Such a distortion is indeed observed in the spin-1/2 vanadium oxyfluoride \n[NH${}_4$]${}_2$[C${}_7$H${}_{14}$N][V${}_7$O${}_6$F${}_{18}$],\nwhich shows no sign of order or spin freezing down to low temperatures~\\cite{Aidoudi2011,Clark2013,Orain2017}.\nIt is thus important to accurately examine the ground state and low-temperature thermodynamic behavior of such distorted model systems. \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\t\\includegraphics{figs/lattices.pdf}\n\t\\caption{(a)\n\tThe breathing kagome lattice with intratrimer bonds $J_\\triangle$ along the upwards triangles and intertrimer bonds $J_\\bigtriangledown$ along the downwards triangles.\n\t(b) \n\tThe triangle-square lattice with the intratrimer bonds $J_1$, $J_2$, and $J_3$ as well as the intertrimer bonds $J$. The $x$ ($y$) lattice direction points to the right (upwards).\n\t}\n\t\\label{fig:lattices}\n\\end{figure}\n\nUnbiased numerical studies of both the undistorted and the breathing distorted kagome lattice have so far been based mainly on exact diagonalization (ED) calculations~\\cite{Yan2011,Sugiura13,Laeuchli19,Schnack18} on (relatively) small clusters, tensor-network methods such as the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)~\\cite{Yan11,Depenbrock2012,Repellin2017,He17}  or infinite projected-entangled pair states (iPEPS) and related approaches~\\cite{Liao17,Chen18,Jahromi2020}, which do however suffer in the case of DMRG from finite-circumference cylinder geometries and in the case of iPEPS from limited accessible bond dimensions. Unbiased quantum Monte Carlo methods such as the stochastic series expansion (SSE)~\\cite{Sandvik1991,Sandvik1992,Sandvik1999,Syljuasen2002,Alet2005} typically suffer from the negative sign problem~\\cite{Henelius00, Troyer2005} in the face of frustration. Averting this basis-dependent sign problem is however possible for a set of special models by performing a local change of basis. A notable example for this is the class of highly-frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnets on lattices with \u201cfully frustrated\u201d interactions, where changing to a suitable cluster basis removes the sign-problem~\\cite{Nakamura1998,Alet2016,Honecker2016,Ng2017,Stapmanns2018,Weber2021}.\n\nIn this work, we show how a suitable cluster basis can also be beneficial in the case of weakly coupled trimer clusters. Here, the sign problem is in general still present but can be reduced to a degree where unbiased calculations of the thermodynamic quantities become possible down to the low-temperature regime. We will perform these calculations for the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on two basic lattices of coupled trimers, highlighting the strengths and shortcomings of this approach\n\nSummarize the preceding context in 7 sentences.
